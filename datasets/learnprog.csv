Tl,dr at the end


## Introduction

I am going to explain how I (M35) transitioned from unemployed living in Barcelona and with barely any front end knowledge to employed in Amsterdam as an entry level front end developer, within 5 months. The main reason why I am writing this post is because, while learning, I met other front end students and many of them saw things unnecessarily hard.

There is a huge demand for developers in the market right now. It is a great time to learn coding, and you don't need years and years of studies to be ""hirable"". A few months of focused learning are enough, and you don't need to spend a dime to learn.

I will explain what I did.

I hope this is useful to you.


## Why studying programming?

I think it is important to start with a positive mindset that somehow you can do this and it is a good idea. I didn't decide to learn front end development right off the bat, I did it because I clearly saw lots of opportunities:

- Using LinkedIn, I compared the amount of job offers (demand) with the amount of people with developer skills (offer). A simple LinkedIn search will give you some rough numbers. Programming had by far the best ratio of demand VS offer, compared to other markets I explored. In my eyes, programming became an obvious choice very, very quickly.

In the current market, as a developer odds are in your favor.

- I talked to a few HR firms, and they all told me that becoming a developer is a great idea because there is a lot of demand, and therefore I would find a job in no time.

- It's just common sense. Most companies, large or small, need some kind of web presence. Web technologies are constantly evolving. This means that you have endless opportunities to find new work.

This makes clear that web developer skills are currently very valuable, and that could help you find the idea of learning web development exciting.

Disclaimer:

I have no computer science degree, but I am more computer versed than the average person. During my PhD (in scientific research) I used linux all the time and became well acquainted with the unix shell (the command console) and the bare basics of programming languages. That was certainly useful to lose the fear to commands and consoles, but it is nothing you cannot acquire in a few days of studying.

Note: I've been told recently that having a PhD helped catch the eye of the interviewer. 


## Why front end web development?

I did compare offer VS demand ratios but it was not very obvious which field of engineering was a better choice. Other fields could have been an equally good or even better choice: data analysis, backend engineering or dev ops to name some. So I talked to people in the sector, asking them what field would bring me a job the fastest, and a couple of them recommended me to look into front end.

Literally one person told me: ""learn HTML, CSS, JavaScript and React, and you're good to get a starting job"".

He was not wrong.

Dev ops salaries are actually higher than in other fields. I would say ultimately depends on your own preferences and previous knowledge. For example, I picked front end for another reason, I am attracted to creating artwork and ""visual works"", so it was a more obvious choice for me. But that doesn't mean it's the best pick for everyone.


## How did I study? What resources did I use?

### FreeCodeCamp

I spent most of my waking hours studying in my room, since I was jobless anyway. I picked [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/), which I had seen recommended online, and followed its program for the first 3 modules. It is an entirely free (with optional donations if you want to help support it), very complete, ""study at your own pace"" introductory course.

I simply followed the program in FreeCodeCamp. It took me around one month to study the first three modules, which include HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript ES6, React/Redux, and a tiny bit of jQuery, Bootstrap and Sass. It is an excellent introduction to front end. You are going to be using most of these every day in your coding life.

### Anki for reviews

One important thing I did right from the start was to take notes of what I studied to later convert them into [Anki cards](https://apps.ankiweb.net/). Initially I also wrote summaries [you can see them here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1YNLZp0YglbjIDhMlyJNClsxasXxK3z_Q?usp=sharing), but I don't think these are worth the time spent on them. The Anki cards however were incredibly valuable. I created the Anki cards at the same time I studied, then every single day I studied the Anki deck. The main reason why Anki cards were so useful is that as you progress through the lessons, information keeps on piling up, and there's gonna be A LOT of new information you will have to learn. Without a review method, I would have forgotten most of the things I studied. Anki allowed me to remember almost everything in a very time-effective way.

I did not use Anki's default configuration. That would be worth its own article, but for starters you could read about the [Janki method](http://www.jackkinsella.ie/articles/janki-method). Making Anki cards is an art, and it is possible to make it wrong. There are 3 main things to keep in mind:

- One card = one and only one item to remember
- Find a quick way to create the cards (Now I write the questions and answers in a plain text file and import the file)
- Lower the repetition thresholds so that cards show up less frequently (to reduce the time spent in reviewing the cards)

That's all I did for about 4 or 5 weeks. I would say I spent on average 4 or 5 hours studying every single day, and it was hard work. If I had been working at the same time in a 40 hour/week job, I would have gone much slower. It is NOT EASY. It required full focus for hours, every day during weeks.

Anyway. I completed the first 3 modules of FreeCodeCamp. There are 7 modules in total, but I don't believe the last 4 are essential to find a job. They would be nice to have though, and would definitely increase your odds. But part of the reason why I am writing this, is to tell you what is the minimum you should do.

### JavaScript.info

After completing the freecodecamp modules I decided I should become a ""JavaScript expert"", so I began reading [javascript.info](http://javascript.info/). This is a very in-depth journey into JavaScript, and of course, it is 100% free. I found this resource very useful, and took the same approach of studying while making Anki cards. Why did I want to learn more about JavaScript? I felt that learning one programming language very well was the best use of my time. Tools, frameworks, these come and go, but JavaScript has come to stay. At least for quite a long while. Having a good grasp of JavaScript is a great use of your time, and when job interviews come, they will test your knowledge about the language. Understand well its nuances: the keyword ""this"", the differences between arrow functions and function declarations, asynchronous code and promises, spread operators, destructuring assignments... sometimes it's gonna be a bit hard for you to tell what is important or what is not when it comes to JavaScript. Particularly in the beginning. In case of doubt, learn it. It won't hurt you.

## What else did I do besides studying?

Besides studying frontend technologies, I also talked to people who worked as front end developers, recruiters, and bootcamp teachers. I talked to a handful of recruiters about my decision to move into the development world. This is the key information I got from them:

- There is indeed a huge need for developers in the market.
- Particularly, the Netherlands is a place in Europe where there is a developer shortage. Companies from this country go to other countries's job fairs to try and recruit talent. Me managing to easily find a job in Amsterdam supports this point.
- A recruiter told me ""the only thing you're missing is some kind of course certificate in your CV. It doesn't need to be official or expensive, anything does it"". The reason? A certificate or course makes it easier for me to sell my CV to companies, given that I have no work experience as a developer. To them, it shows commitment.

In addition, I found a government-funded bootcamp in my city which costed me zero money (only a few coins spent on the coffee machine). The quality was very low. I completed it nonetheless and added it to my CV. All in all, the bootcamp was not a very useful way to spend my time and I'm not sure if it factored in getting a job in any significant way. My guess is it didn't, so I won't expand into it. There's not much of a take away here. Ultimately, what interviewees care most about is whether you can use front end tools or not. In sum, having a course of sorts in your CV is not going to hurt you, but you don't NEED it so don't let it be a blocker.

How do you know when you are ready to look for a job? I had no idea back then. In retrospective, I would say that the minimum to get a first job is:

- Get well acquainted with HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript/ES6 and the fundamentals of one framework (React or Vue). This will take the longest time by far.
- Feel confortable with JS asynchronous code: that means Promises and async/await syntax.
- Understand the basics about fetching data as JSON from external resources via APIs.
- Goes without saying, but become familiar with an IDE, npm, git, github and some basic bash/unix commands. You'll get this knowledge while you learn the rest, so don't worry too much.


## How did I look for a job?

Nothing special. I searched with LinkedIn, Indeed and Google, and in a couple of local job boards of the Netherlands and Denmark.

I was very careful in crafting my resume. One friend (thank you Miguel) had fine tuned his by getting feedback from many recruiters over the years, and I used the same structure. The advice I got could be summarized as follows:

- Put the most relevant thing on top. Usually, relevant work experience is the most important thing. For your first job, it might be education instead. The most recent things should also go on top (always from newest to oldest).
- Limit your CV to one single A4 page in one side. That will force you to remove the unimportant.
- For each item in the CV (job experience, course...) use 2-4 bullet points to indicate what relevant things YOU (not your team) did. Be technical, brief and specific. Do not write long paragraphs, no one is going to read them.

I sent my resume as if I was shooting a machine gun, and I didn't use a motivation letter.

Finding a job was easy. My current job came out of spending one hour sending resumes. I only got a confirmation after 1 month, so I still put aside around 2 hours every 3 or 4 days to batch send resumes.


## How did the job interviews go?

The 4 interviews I did followed the same structure.

The first part was about getting to know you. You are asked why you applied to the job, what's your background and what are your expectations. Companies like smart employees that have a ""will do / will fix"" positive attitude and that don't plan to leave the company in 6 months. Try to show these traits while you tell your story and in the way you communicate. For example, I was warned that the rental market in Amsterdam is hard to navigate. I immediately replied that I've had to look for a flat abroad in other occasions, and that I was sure I could figure that out.

The second part was the technical interview. The key here is that, if you have studied enough, this will simply be about showing what you already know well, so you should not be worried about it. I faced 3 types of technical interviews, either explaining the code of a project you have done, being asked technical questions, or getting a homework project. Let's look at each one by one:

### Describing the code of one of your projects

I was asked to pick up any one of my recent projects, go through the code and explain it. At some point I was also asked to do a bit of code refactoring (improving your code for better readability and structure). In my opinion this is the most logical type of technical interview, because the fundamental knowledge is implied, and you are showing that you have technical knowledge. If you're going to face this interview, you must have learned well HTML, CSS, JavaScript ES6 and one frontend framework, and then you must have done 2 or 3 *TINY* projects with it. Think at the widget level more than at the full website level. This is the project I used in the interview: https://github.com/luismartinezs/studio-ghibli-books, as you can see it is very damn simple, but it was enough to show that I had a decent grasp of the fundamentals.

### Technical questions

I was asked about ES6 JavaScript features. What does it mean adding ""..."" in front of an array or an object? What are the differences between a function declaration and an arrow function? This type of evaluation is a bit trickier in my opinion, because you may get lucky or unlucky with the questions and your knowledge might be either overestimated or underestimated as a consequence.

### Homework projects

I was handed a project after an interview with Accenture. It took me around 20 hours to complete, and I only got a reply after one entire month (they replied that they wanted someone with more experience). This type of tests are usually asked for when the interviewer doesn't have technical knowledge and cannot evaluate you on the spot, so they pass the results of the test to the technical team for evaluation. I would suggest declining this type of tests. A company asking you to spend even 4 hours to solve a test just to evaluate you, rather than having someone from their technical team interview you, is asking you to waste your time. Only do the test if you have nothing better to do and you see the test as practice.

The bottom line is very simple: understand well the fundamentals, and the rest will follow.


## What would I do differently?

There's very little I would have done different. There's only one way I could have gone faster: first, skip the part about jQuery in freecodecamp. After finishing the first 3 modules of freecodecamp, I would have skipped the bootcamp and begun building 2 or 3 sample projects with React. These projects should:

- Look like something you might see in a website
- They should be very simple, e.g. 2-3 days per project, which at your initial level will be the time you'll need to do a very simple widget from scratch
- Need to incorporate proper calls to external APIs, using fetch.

Once I had these done, I would have begun looking for a job, as I would know everything required to perform decently well in an interview.

Thant's all for now. I'm happy to reply to any questions or comments that you may have.

- From jobless and with no specific frontend knowledge to an entry level job in 5 months
- Money spent: 0
- Time spent studying: roughly 2.5 months, around 5 hours per day.
- Study material: mainly freecodecamp modules 1 to 3 and javascript.info
- Focused studying, with emphasis on deep understanding
- Use a review system for the things you learn, Anki cards or something else
- Put some effort in structuring well your resume so that it's relevant and easy to read","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Note: I wrote this with the aim of documenting my journey and helping others.

&lt;p&gt;I spent most of my waking hours studying in my room, since I was jobless anyway. I picked &lt;a href=""https://www.freecodecamp.org/""&gt;FreeCodeCamp&lt;/a&gt;, which I had seen recommended online, and followed its program for the first 3 modules. It is an entirely free (with optional donations if you want to help support it), very complete, &amp;quot;study at your own pace&amp;quot; introductory course.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I simply followed the program in FreeCodeCamp. It took me around one month to study the first three modules, which include HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript ES6, React/Redux, and a tiny bit of jQuery, Bootstrap and Sass. It is an excellent introduction to front end. You are going to be using most of these every day in your coding life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Anki for reviews&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One important thing I did right from the start was to take notes of what I studied to later convert them into &lt;a href=""https://apps.ankiweb.net/""&gt;Anki cards&lt;/a&gt;. Initially I also wrote summaries &lt;a href=""https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1YNLZp0YglbjIDhMlyJNClsxasXxK3z_Q?usp=sharing""&gt;you can see them here&lt;/a&gt;, but I don&amp;#39;t think these are worth the time spent on them. The Anki cards however were incredibly valuable. I created the Anki cards at the same time I studied, then every single day I studied the Anki deck. The main reason why Anki cards were so useful is that as you progress through the lessons, information keeps on piling up, and there&amp;#39;s gonna be A LOT of new information you will have to learn. Without a review method, I would have forgotten most of the things I studied. Anki allowed me to remember almost everything in a very time-effective way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did not use Anki&amp;#39;s default configuration. That would be worth its own article, but for starters you could read about the &lt;a href=""http://www.jackkinsella.ie/articles/janki-method""&gt;Janki method&lt;/a&gt;. Making Anki cards is an art, and it is possible to make it wrong. There are 3 main things to keep in mind:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One card = one and only one item to remember&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Find a quick way to create the cards (Now I write the questions and answers in a plain text file and import the file)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lower the repetition thresholds so that cards show up less frequently (to reduce the time spent in reviewing the cards)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s all I did for about 4 or 5 weeks. I would say I spent on average 4 or 5 hours studying every single day, and it was hard work. If I had been working at the same time in a 40 hour/week job, I would have gone much slower. It is NOT EASY. It required full focus for hours, every day during weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway. I completed the first 3 modules of FreeCodeCamp. There are 7 modules in total, but I don&amp;#39;t believe the last 4 are essential to find a job. They would be nice to have though, and would definitely increase your odds. But part of the reason why I am writing this, is to tell you what is the minimum you should do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;JavaScript.info&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After completing the freecodecamp modules I decided I should become a &amp;quot;JavaScript expert&amp;quot;, so I began reading &lt;a href=""http://javascript.info/""&gt;javascript.info&lt;/a&gt;. This is a very in-depth journey into JavaScript, and of course, it is 100% free. I found this resource very useful, and took the same approach of studying while making Anki cards. Why did I want to learn more about JavaScript? I felt that learning one programming language very well was the best use of my time. Tools, frameworks, these come and go, but JavaScript has come to stay. At least for quite a long while. Having a good grasp of JavaScript is a great use of your time, and when job interviews come, they will test your knowledge about the language. Understand well its nuances: the keyword &amp;quot;this&amp;quot;, the differences between arrow functions and function declarations, asynchronous code and promises, spread operators, destructuring assignments... sometimes it&amp;#39;s gonna be a bit hard for you to tell what is important or what is not when it comes to JavaScript. Particularly in the beginning. In case of doubt, learn it. It won&amp;#39;t hurt you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What else did I do besides studying?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Besides studying frontend technologies, I also talked to people who worked as front end developers, recruiters, and bootcamp teachers. I talked to a handful of recruiters about my decision to move into the development world. This is the key information I got from them:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is indeed a huge need for developers in the market.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Particularly, the Netherlands is a place in Europe where there is a developer shortage. Companies from this country go to other countries&amp;#39;s job fairs to try and recruit talent. Me managing to easily find a job in Amsterdam supports this point.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A recruiter told me &amp;quot;the only thing you&amp;#39;re missing is some kind of course certificate in your CV. It doesn&amp;#39;t need to be official or expensive, anything does it&amp;quot;. The reason? A certificate or course makes it easier for me to sell my CV to companies, given that I have no work experience as a developer. To them, it shows commitment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, I found a government-funded bootcamp in my city which costed me zero money (only a few coins spent on the coffee machine). The quality was very low. I completed it nonetheless and added it to my CV. All in all, the bootcamp was not a very useful way to spend my time and I&amp;#39;m not sure if it factored in getting a job in any significant way. My guess is it didn&amp;#39;t, so I won&amp;#39;t expand into it. There&amp;#39;s not much of a take away here. Ultimately, what interviewees care most about is whether you can use front end tools or not. In sum, having a course of sorts in your CV is not going to hurt you, but you don&amp;#39;t NEED it so don&amp;#39;t let it be a blocker.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How do you know when you are ready to look for a job? I had no idea back then. In retrospective, I would say that the minimum to get a first job is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get well acquainted with HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript/ES6 and the fundamentals of one framework (React or Vue). This will take the longest time by far.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Feel confortable with JS asynchronous code: that means Promises and async/await syntax.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Understand the basics about fetching data as JSON from external resources via APIs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Goes without saying, but become familiar with an IDE, npm, git, github and some basic bash/unix commands. You&amp;#39;ll get this knowledge while you learn the rest, so don&amp;#39;t worry too much.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;How did I look for a job?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nothing special. I searched with LinkedIn, Indeed and Google, and in a couple of local job boards of the Netherlands and Denmark.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was very careful in crafting my resume. One friend (thank you Miguel) had fine tuned his by getting feedback from many recruiters over the years, and I used the same structure. The advice I got could be summarized as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Put the most relevant thing on top. Usually, relevant work experience is the most important thing. For your first job, it might be education instead. The most recent things should also go on top (always from newest to oldest).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Limit your CV to one single A4 page in one side. That will force you to remove the unimportant.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For each item in the CV (job experience, course...) use 2-4 bullet points to indicate what relevant things YOU (not your team) did. Be technical, brief and specific. Do not write long paragraphs, no one is going to read them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I sent my resume as if I was shooting a machine gun, and I didn&amp;#39;t use a motivation letter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finding a job was easy. My current job came out of spending one hour sending resumes. I only got a confirmation after 1 month, so I still put aside around 2 hours every 3 or 4 days to batch send resumes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;How did the job interviews go?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 4 interviews I did followed the same structure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first part was about getting to know you. You are asked why you applied to the job, what&amp;#39;s your background and what are your expectations. Companies like smart employees that have a &amp;quot;will do / will fix&amp;quot; positive attitude and that don&amp;#39;t plan to leave the company in 6 months. Try to show these traits while you tell your story and in the way you communicate. For example, I was warned that the rental market in Amsterdam is hard to navigate. I immediately replied that I&amp;#39;ve had to look for a flat abroad in other occasions, and that I was sure I could figure that out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second part was the technical interview. The key here is that, if you have studied enough, this will simply be about showing what you already know well, so you should not be worried about it. I faced 3 types of technical interviews, either explaining the code of a project you have done, being asked technical questions, or getting a homework project. Let&amp;#39;s look at each one by one:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Describing the code of one of your projects&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was asked to pick up any one of my recent projects, go through the code and explain it. At some point I was also asked to do a bit of code refactoring (improving your code for better readability and structure). In my opinion this is the most logical type of technical interview, because the fundamental knowledge is implied, and you are showing that you have technical knowledge. If you&amp;#39;re going to face this interview, you must have learned well HTML, CSS, JavaScript ES6 and one frontend framework, and then you must have done 2 or 3 &lt;em&gt;TINY&lt;/em&gt; projects with it. Think at the widget level more than at the full website level. This is the project I used in the interview: &lt;a href=""https://github.com/luismartinezs/studio-ghibli-books""&gt;https://github.com/luismartinezs/studio-ghibli-books&lt;/a&gt;, as you can see it is very damn simple, but it was enough to show that I had a decent grasp of the fundamentals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Technical questions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was asked about ES6 JavaScript features. What does it mean adding &amp;quot;...&amp;quot; in front of an array or an object? What are the differences between a function declaration and an arrow function? This type of evaluation is a bit trickier in my opinion, because you may get lucky or unlucky with the questions and your knowledge might be either overestimated or underestimated as a consequence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Homework projects&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was handed a project after an interview with Accenture. It took me around 20 hours to complete, and I only got a reply after one entire month (they replied that they wanted someone with more experience). This type of tests are usually asked for when the interviewer doesn&amp;#39;t have technical knowledge and cannot evaluate you on the spot, so they pass the results of the test to the technical team for evaluation. I would suggest declining this type of tests. A company asking you to spend even 4 hours to solve a test just to evaluate you, rather than having someone from their technical team interview you, is asking you to waste your time. Only do the test if you have nothing better to do and you see the test as practice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bottom line is very simple: understand well the fundamentals, and the rest will follow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What would I do differently?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s very little I would have done different. There&amp;#39;s only one way I could have gone faster: first, skip the part about jQuery in freecodecamp. After finishing the first 3 modules of freecodecamp, I would have skipped the bootcamp and begun building 2 or 3 sample projects with React. These projects should:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Look like something you might see in a website&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They should be very simple, e.g. 2-3 days per project, which at your initial level will be the time you&amp;#39;ll need to do a very simple widget from scratch&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Need to incorporate proper calls to external APIs, using fetch.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once I had these done, I would have begun looking for a job, as I would know everything required to perform decently well in an interview.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thant&amp;#39;s all for now. I&amp;#39;m happy to reply to any questions or comments that you may have.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Links&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.freecodecamp.org/""&gt;FreeCodeCamp&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=""https://apps.ankiweb.net/""&gt;Anki cards&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=""http://www.jackkinsella.ie/articles/janki-method""&gt;Janki method&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=""http://javascript.info/""&gt;javascript.info&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=""https://github.com/luismartinezs/studio-ghibli-books""&gt;A project I used in a job interview&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;tl,dr&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;From jobless and with no specific frontend knowledge to an entry level job in 5 months&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Money spent: 0&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Time spent studying: roughly 2.5 months, around 5 hours per day.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Study material: mainly freecodecamp modules 1 to 3 and javascript.info&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Focused studying, with emphasis on deep understanding&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use a review system for the things you learn, Anki cards or something else&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Put some effort in structuring well your resume so that it&amp;#39;s relevant and easy to read&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

I can't pretend to know my way around APIs generally and Spotify's API specifically, but I had an idea for an upcoming friend-hackathon and I would appreciate your initial guidance.

Background: I am a huge power user of Spotify and in addition to finding music through Spotify's increasingly intelligent curation algorithms, I also discover lots of my music through my friends on Spotify, either by sifting through their playlists or by observing the songs they are listening to via Spotify's ""Friend Activity"" sidebar.

Feature request: I like this ""Friend Activity"" capability but I wish it could be enhanced in two ways: (i) can friend activity  be visible on mobile so I can tune in on-the-go? And (ii) can I literally ""tune-in"" to their session like I would a radio station through some sort of ""synchronous/go live"" mode so we can both be listening to whatever it is that the friend plays? Sort of like FB Live, anyone could tune into anyone else's ""live mix sessions"": I'd like to explore ways this can be built.

\-String methods indexOf, charAt, length, substring(split is not allowed)

\-if-else statements and switches

\-while, do-while, for loops

That means no arrays, no integer methods, no classes, no packages other than java.util.Scanner, not even a return statement.

I managed to isolate the operands in integer form individually using 2 nested for loops and some arithmetic skills, but trying to wrap my head around everything else without using integer methods nor arrays feels like swimming without arms or legs

Any help is greatly appreciated

Sorry if the code formatting doesn't look right, I can never get it to work right.

I have two problems with the above code, one is concerning the memset(3) function in the second for loop. The second problem I have is with the val2 variable having some random character appended to the end of what it is initialized to. 

So I have written this program in C to learn more about the memset(3) function. For the most part everything works as expected. In the first if statement the goal is to overwrite the first 6 values of str with the 6 values of val1. The program does this and the value of str after the first for loop is 'stringC from [trytoprogram.com](https://trytoprogram.com)'. This is expected and I'm cool with it.

now the second for loop is to replace the last 10 values of str with the 10 values of val2. this happens but instead of writing 

'stringC from [trytopr](https://trytoprogram.com)burntToast' which is what I expect I am getting 'stringC from trytoprburntToastburntToast.'

&amp;#x200B;

so with this you can see that it is writing val2 twice and the end of str, AND there is a period on the end, that was the random character that was appended to val2 for some reason.  I have a picture added of the output of my last execution

&amp;#x200B;

So I'm  trying to figure out why there is a random char in val2, and why the second memset(3) is writing all the extra values.

In my tutorials about linked lists, I notice that whenever they demonstrate ""reversing"" a linked list, it involved actually changing the positions of the nodes themselves around.

e.g:

current = null;prev = null;

temp = [current.](https://currentNode.next)prev;current = prev...

however, the way I do it is to simply change the DATA of the nodes around. for example, if the nodes contain int information; ill just switch the HEAD node data with the TAIL node data. Then go onto the next node after head. go onto the previous node in tail.

    	Node currentHead = head // global variable
            Node currentTail = tail; // global variable
    
    	while (currentTail.next != currentHead &amp;&amp; currentTail != currentHead) {

What is the smallest possible number of pages that might be used by this index? How deep is the tree in this case? How many keys are in the root node?*

I have done a fair amount of learning in regards to B+ Trees for indexes, so I know that B+ trees require each page to be over 50% full (other than the root), and that all leaves are at the same level. However, how do I go about answering these questions? It obviously depends on the fanout/branching factor, but I have no clue how to move forward...

I am thinking that the smallest possible number of pages is in a scenario with as many pages as possible are completely full (200 keys). If we had 492 pages that are completely full, with 200 keys each, we would have 52 keys in the last page, which violates the 50% rule. So would the answer to the first question be 493, since we would have 491 pages that are completely full, and the last two pages have around 126 each?

What is the smallest possible number of pages that might be used by this index? How deep is the tree in this case? How many keys are in the root node?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have done a fair amount of learning in regards to B+ Trees for indexes, so I know that B+ trees require each page to be over 50% full (other than the root), and that all leaves are at the same level. However, how do I go about answering these questions? It obviously depends on the fanout/branching factor, but I have no clue how to move forward...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am thinking that the smallest possible number of pages is in a scenario with as many pages as possible are completely full (200 keys). If we had 492 pages that are completely full, with 200 keys each, we would have 52 keys in the last page, which violates the 50% rule. So would the answer to the first question be 493, since we would have 491 pages that are completely full, and the last two pages have around 126 each? I am confused about how the tree would look with the different levels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any help would be greatly appreciated! I am especially lost on the second and third parts of the question (&amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;How deep is the tree in this case?, How many keys are in the root node?&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot;), since I am not sure how the tree would look at all...&lt;/p&gt;

The challenge is :  Return the lowest index at which a value (second argument) should be  inserted into an array (first argument) once it has been sorted. The  returned value should be a number.

&lt;p&gt;I used some time to research and found that [OpenStreetMap](&lt;a href=""https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Main_Page""&gt;https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Main_Page&lt;/a&gt;) might me good for this. To get this to work with c++ I found another c++ project called [Osmium library](&lt;a href=""https://osmcode.org/libosmium/""&gt;https://osmcode.org/libosmium/&lt;/a&gt;).  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So my questions are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is it even possible to get what I want from Osmium library?&lt;br/&gt;
How to set up my project properly? Do I just clone it and put it into my project folder?&lt;/p&gt;

From Cracking the Coding Interview, they seem to suggest it's O(2\^n). However, when I walk through the code by hand, it seems the runtime is definitely not exponential... E.g. for 4, the num of calls seems to be 9, not 16. For 5, the num of calls seems to be 15, not 32 (they mention that it's closer to 1.6\^n, which still is nowhere near close to the actual number of calls, i.e. for 5, it'd be 10 and not 15). It seems like to me the runtime would be something like O( (0.7n)\^2) which would then be O(n\^2)..?

&lt;p&gt;From Cracking the Coding Interview, they seem to suggest it&amp;#39;s O(2^n). However, when I walk through the code by hand, it seems the runtime is definitely not exponential... E.g. for 4, the num of calls seems to be 9, not 16. For 5, the num of calls seems to be 15, not 32 (they mention that it&amp;#39;s closer to 1.6^n, which still is nowhere near close to the actual number of calls, i.e. for 5, it&amp;#39;d be 10 and not 15). It seems like to me the runtime would be something like O( (0.7n)^2) which would then be O(n^2)..?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thoughts? Where is my mistake?&lt;/p&gt;

Every non-zero length string of characters is an *attribute*.

An attribute can be *open*, which means that there is a unique string of characters that specifies its *start* and the attribute continues from its start for some specific number of characters. Or it can be *closed*, which means there is a unique string of characters that specifies its *start* and and a unique string of characters that specifies its *end*. Part of an attribute that is not its *start* or *end* is called *content*.

All attributes can be grouped into precedence groups. All attributes in every precedence group are left-to-right associative.

Some attributes can contain some other attributes i.e. can have other attributes as its content. The container attribute is called *parent* in relation to the contained attributes and contained attributes are called *children* in relation to the container attribute.

## Parsing algorithms

Since I'm asking how to develop one, I can't describe a correct parsing algorithm here. I can, however, describe 2 failed algorithms that I have tried to use to parse this kind of grammar.

### Tables

Consider a string *S* of length *L(S)* characters. Consider that there are *A* attributes. Then we can construct a table with *L(S)* rows and *A* columns i.e. a two-dimensional array. Every field *(x,y)* shall contain a boolean value *true* if the row *x* contains attribute *y* and value *false* if it does not.

We can fill out this table by scanning the input string in precedence groups e.g. having a `for` loop for every precedence group in descending order (from highest to lowest precedence group). Each for loop will start scanning the input string from the beginning. Each of these input string will test for each of the attributes in its precedence group starting from the current offset. In case the character at the current offset is found to belong to the higher precedence group it is skipped. In case it matches one of the attributes of the current precedence group the appropriate fields in the table are set to true and the offset is updated past the attribute. If the attribute can contain some other attributes the entire parsing process is performed on the attribute's content as the input string (with attributes that can't be contained within it excluded). If none of these two conditions are met the offset is simply incremented.

**The problem with this approach is that it is unable to represent the situation in which the attribute contains itself.**

### Trees

Tree is a structure that contains three fields:

1. An array of its children, from left to right (*nodes*).
2. Its content.
3. Its attribute type (attribute of the content).

Notice that tables do contain *start* and *end* of an attribute along with its *content*, but trees contain only *content*.

With an array of trees we can represent the entire document. If a tree is of a type that can contain other attributes, the tree itself has no content but its nodes do.

The parsing algorithm is very similar to the one described in tables, but with trees instead of a table. So I don't see a point in explaining it again.

**The problem with this approach is that the resulting trees contain nodes not in the order in which they appear in the input string but in the precedence order groups, in which the input string is scanned. (The node order as in the precedence groups themselves is ok, though.)**

---

I think that's it. If you have any questions or need examples just feel free to ask. It's intentionally written in an abstract way so you are not constrained by the actual attribute specifications in constructing the algorithm.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Grammar&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every non-zero length string of characters is an &lt;em&gt;attribute&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An attribute can be &lt;em&gt;open&lt;/em&gt;, which means that there is a unique string of characters that specifies its &lt;em&gt;start&lt;/em&gt; and the attribute continues from its start for some specific number of characters. Or it can be &lt;em&gt;closed&lt;/em&gt;, which means there is a unique string of characters that specifies its &lt;em&gt;start&lt;/em&gt; and and a unique string of characters that specifies its &lt;em&gt;end&lt;/em&gt;. Part of an attribute that is not its &lt;em&gt;start&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;end&lt;/em&gt; is called &lt;em&gt;content&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All attributes can be grouped into precedence groups. All attributes in every precedence group are left-to-right associative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some attributes can contain some other attributes i.e. can have other attributes as its content. The container attribute is called &lt;em&gt;parent&lt;/em&gt; in relation to the contained attributes and contained attributes are called &lt;em&gt;children&lt;/em&gt; in relation to the container attribute.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Tables&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consider a string &lt;em&gt;S&lt;/em&gt; of length &lt;em&gt;L(S)&lt;/em&gt; characters. Consider that there are &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; attributes. Then we can construct a table with &lt;em&gt;L(S)&lt;/em&gt; rows and &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; columns i.e. a two-dimensional array. Every field &lt;em&gt;(x,y)&lt;/em&gt; shall contain a boolean value &lt;em&gt;true&lt;/em&gt; if the row &lt;em&gt;x&lt;/em&gt; contains attribute &lt;em&gt;y&lt;/em&gt; and value &lt;em&gt;false&lt;/em&gt; if it does not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can fill out this table by scanning the input string in precedence groups e.g. having a &lt;code&gt;for&lt;/code&gt; loop for every precedence group in descending order (from highest to lowest precedence group). Each for loop will start scanning the input string from the beginning. Each of these input string will test for each of the attributes in its precedence group starting from the current offset. In case the character at the current offset is found to belong to the higher precedence group it is skipped. In case it matches one of the attributes of the current precedence group the appropriate fields in the table are set to true and the offset is updated past the attribute. If the attribute can contain some other attributes the entire parsing process is performed on the attribute&amp;#39;s content as the input string (with attributes that can&amp;#39;t be contained within it excluded). If none of these two conditions are met the offset is simply incremented.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The problem with this approach is that it is unable to represent the situation in which the attribute contains itself.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Trees&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tree is a structure that contains three fields:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An array of its children, from left to right (&lt;em&gt;nodes&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Its content.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Its attribute type (attribute of the content).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notice that tables do contain &lt;em&gt;start&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;end&lt;/em&gt; of an attribute along with its &lt;em&gt;content&lt;/em&gt;, but trees contain only &lt;em&gt;content&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With an array of trees we can represent the entire document. If a tree is of a type that can contain other attributes, the tree itself has no content but its nodes do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The parsing algorithm is very similar to the one described in tables, but with trees instead of a table. So I don&amp;#39;t see a point in explaining it again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The problem with this approach is that the resulting trees contain nodes not in the order in which they appear in the input string but in the precedence order groups, in which the input string is scanned. (The node order as in the precedence groups themselves is ok, though.)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think that&amp;#39;s it. If you have any questions or need examples just feel free to ask. It&amp;#39;s intentionally written in an abstract way so you are not constrained by the actual attribute specifications in constructing the algorithm.&lt;/p&gt;

Thanks for reading, 

The objective is the let the user enter a QR code from a book:

aName = author

bTitle = Title

location = different libraries

year = year  

variables ""aName"" and ""bTitle"" are supposed to have 15 and 20 spots reserved in the books QR code, however, If ""aName"" or ""bTitle"" are longer than 15 or 20 it is also supposed to work. 

Im having a hard time trying to wrap my head around that logic:

Im thinking ill have to create an ""if statement"" stating something like ""if aName || bTitle greater than 15 &amp;&amp; 20 ignore string out of bounds exception"" ? 

Perhaps there's an easier way to do it so if anyone has any other suggestions - I would really appreciate it....Thanks!","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;/*

dog.woof();

After checking if the pet parameter is an instance of Dog, why do I have to downcast pet before calling woof()? Doesn't the if statement already prove that the pet is an instance of Dog so I can just call woof() on the pet parameter? This stuff always confuses me.

&lt;p&gt;I am confused on what&amp;#39;s happening inside of the speak function, specifically in the if statements. After checking if the pet parameter is an instance of Dog, why do I have to downcast pet before calling woof()? Doesn&amp;#39;t the if statement already prove that the pet is an instance of Dog so I can just call woof() on the pet parameter? This stuff always confuses me.

My idea is to use the following versioning system: *A*.*B*.*C*.*D*, where:

The problem with that, of course, is that [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) allows for only *A*.*B*.*C* with pre-release and build metadata suffixed.

I took a break, and tried it once again about ten years ago, for a year.  Since then, mostly in software development land.

Recently, there was a post about why beginner tutorials are bad.  Let me relate a story in reaction to that.  About 15 years ago, Ruby on Rails was perhaps at its height, and I attended a conference of sort called ""No Fluff Just Stuff"".  The idea was to have a traveling band of speakers who would talk about anything that wasn't Microsoft.  Ruby on Rails fit the bill (Java and Javascript was also popular then, as well as agile, etc).

One speaker making the rounds was Dave Thomas.  If you're old enough, he was the Wendy's guy (only, he wasn't).  If not, maybe you know him as Pragmatic Programmer guy, and certainly, he did a lot to popularize Ruby.  I think he helped translate a Ruby book in Japanese (or at least, some approximation of a translation) into English, and that helped its popularity outside of Japan.

While most of his talks were about building apps for Ruby on Rails, he gave one talk about the differing levels of expertise from novice (complete beginner) to expert.  Experts, he noted (much like the guy commenting on beginner tutorials), tend to talk at a high level in shorthand to one another, and this isn't good for beginners.  He related a story of where he was a beginner (in flying airplanes) and made rookie mistakes which his instructor warned him about.

Point is, most people who want to create a tutorial know their audience are beginners.  They aren't deliberately assuming they've seen a dozen languages and have a Ph.D. in astrophysics.  They are making an attempt to explain stuff, at what they think is a beginner level.  I mean, if every expert failed to explain something somewhat simply, than why bother have colleges.  They are already too far gone to teach.  Even people who have struggled to master something sometimes fixate too much on their own issues (which may be kind of obscure and not of general interest to the student) rather than present stuff that might be easy to them, and tough to others.

The biggest problem isn't so much they're an expert that has lost touch (although that is partly true), it's that they need more experience teaching.  This means, you need to teach students, and then test them, and see what they do understand and what they don't understand.  You need to find out what they're thinking, and what's causing them to have problems.  That means (IMO) you need to talk to students, and figure where they're coming from, and try to get them to understand how to think about programming.

The problem, then, is most teachers haven't taught where they get feedback from the students, revise what teach because of the problems they saw.  For example, one semester, I was teaching HTML as one part of the course.  By the end of the semester, they had pretty much forgotten HTML.  So, I made every test (of which there were many) cumulative, and this forced them to review HTML again and again and again, so the second semester I taught it, I think they retained it better (yes, maybe they forgot it 6 months later, but that's another story).

So, lesson of why it's hard to teach.  Until you teach in front of students and talk to them, you don't understand where they're coming from, and what misconceptions they have, so you can adjust to what they're learning.

**Books**

In general, I kinda like books (or webpages structured like books).  They have a linear structure, and for physical books, they often have editors that review the content (where webpages often lack this).

Books have a problem, though.  Do you want to learn from the book, or do you want to use the book as a reference?   Most books attempt to do both, but lean more on being a reference book.  For example, one C book I taught from started with print statements in one chapter (and input), then conditionals in the next, loops in the next chapter, then arrays, functions, pointers, structures, etc.

It was split up this way so that all the related information about loops (say, for loops, while loops, nested loops, etc) were in one chapter.  Maybe a better way to teach is to only use the while loop for a while, and introduce for loops much later on.  But if you do that, then when you go back to review, loops are split up.

What might be better ordering for teaching might be worse for a reference.

**Syntax vs. writing a program**

If you were to learn a foreign language from a university vs. learning it from some online program, perhaps the biggest difference is the approach.  A university is probably going to teach it rather formally, talking about nouns, verbs, conjugation, grammar.  They want you to look at the language as a linguist would.

On the other hand, popular language courses are about teaching you useful phrases, and mostly skipping the grammar, or at least, not emphasizing it as much.  They are aimed at tourists who aren't expected to reach a level of mastery, but just good enough to communicate and to understand a few key phrases.

This happens with programming language instruction.  I'm looking at the intro material for ElixirSchool, and the first several chapters are syntax, syntax, syntax.  Here are some libraries.  Here are the list of all functions in that libraries.  This is the equivalent of teaching grammar in a creative writing course without ever getting to the writing part.

By contrast, video tutorials are like the ""learn a few phrases"" approach to teaching a foreign language.  They sometimes care more about getting some application to work, without worrying too much about the basics of programming, or even what's going on.  For example, you might have a tutorial about how to write a blog in Ruby on Rails, but it may not cover what a web application is and how it is basically structured, and why it's structured in a way that a person who just learned Ruby might say is strange.

You essentially learn things at a superficial level (where that detail in learning all the functions of a library *might* be useful), and when you want to do something different, you don't understand the thinking that lead to the design in the first place.  And code is particularly brittle.  One little error, and you're left wondering how to fix it.

Dave Thomas said that one thing a novice wants is precision, and a well-defined set of tasks that has visible goals.  They don't want to hear that it takes a pinch of salt.  Is that 1/8 of a teaspoon, or 1/4?  What does it mean ""to taste"" (many professional chefs would argue the average home cook, scared of salt, undersalts too much food).

So something aimed to beginners should try to follow this mantra.

**Debugging?  Right**

One task a beginner does a lot of is fixing bugs, but I don't recall books ever going into the topic much.  They might (but probably not) cover a debugger.  The problem with covering a debugger is you need to pick an IDE.  Most languages don't define a debugger as part of the langauge.  Once you pick an IDE, then the popularity of a book or tutorial probably goes down.

**The environment of programming**

OK, let's say a book somehow manages to cover some programs.  Here's a problem to be solved, here's how to think about it, and here is the resulting program being run.

But, to start, you have to worry about a bunch of things

* how do I install the language?
* how do I know which version to install?
* when should I upgrade the language to the next version?
* what is the workflow?  what should I do after I write the program?  
* what IDE should I use?  Or text editor?

Many books/tutorials start with the single file approach.  Your entire program in one file.  A very interesting test for a programming language is how it deals with two program files.  C had a simple approach.

    cc foo.c bar.c baz.c

If you wanted to compile three C files, then only one should have a a `main()`, and you add more arguments to the `cc` (the C compiler) to compile into one executable.

Nearly every modern language had moved to some sort of build tool.  They teach you how to deal with one file and how to run it by itself, but it's almost never how you're really supposed to do it.  So you have leiningen for Clojure, go build for Go programs, mix for Elixir.

But even beyond that, you have to make a decision on what editor to use or should you use a full IDE. Most books and tutorials shy away from recommending an IDE.  After all, what happens if a student says ""We don't use that at our college"", or ""I prefer this other IDE"", so they may stop reading.  

I've been reading about how Elixir sets up projects.  But it's not exactly explained.  C didn't really have a notion of projects, so why does Elixir?  Many tutorials take it for granted that the language works a certain way, but don't bother to explain why it works that way (probably because the author doesn't know).

Elixir has a directory for having test programs because the consensus is we need testing as part of the language, but there isn't explanation of why testing is needed, or Elixir's approach to testing.

**How to read a program**

So, most books tend to teach syntax.  If you're lucky, they might tell you how to write some programs.  But it's rare to see books which chapters devoted to debugging (because then you need a problem, and you don't want it to be so complicated that understanding the problem is hard enough, let alone debugging it).

But how many books cover reading a program, going over line by line what the program is doing.  It's almost like programming is only writing, not reading, when most people end up maintaining code other people wrote.

**Building a mental model**

Suppose you wanted to hire a bunch of people to build a house, and you get to supervise.  As you provide instructions, you can see the results, and correct any mistakes hopefully quickly. 

But most programming is done somewhat blind.  You see the code, but you don't see the values changing unless you get good at using the debugger, or you understand, mentally, what the program is doing.

Imagine you want to build the house, but this time, the house is being built by a robot, and you provide it instructions, but you have to provide it ahead of time, and the robot will build the house away from your sight, and you don't get to look at it until it's done.

I've seen many students who look at their code in a static sort of way, and don't really trace, step-by-step, what their code does.  When they fix their code, it's by some random changes.  ""I don't know what it does.  I lack the patience to follow it step by step.  Let's try spinning!"" (Phantom Menace reference).

**Inventing syntax**

Young kids, when they hear a foreign language, pretend they can speak it by imitating sounds.  Maybe they hear ""ee, er, san"" when they hear Chinese or ""mon dieu"" when they hear French.  Pig Latin is applying rules that make a faux Latin (I guess).

Quite often, beginners apply rules they haven't been taught, but infer based on personal experience.  So, even without seeing this, many students write code like

     if (x == 1 || 4 || 7) {

to mean if `x` has a value of 1 or 4 or 7.  That is, they feel the equality operator distributes over || (many languages, it doesn't).  It comes from a semi-intelligent place, but it happens to be wrong.

Or, Java (and other languages) have a `compare` method which many things returns -1, 0, 1, but really returns negative, zero, and positive numbers.  If you believe the first is true, then you're going to wonder why comparing to 1 isn't giving you the right answers.

**A balanced approach**

I think you need to balance teaching syntax with writing programs.  If it's all syntax, then you sit around doing nothing, and it's probably hard to absorb the material anyway.  If you do too many programs, it's possible you don't understand how to read the programs (you're just copying code) nor how to think about writing programs.

**Conclusion**

To teach to beginners, you need to teach beginners, preferably before you put content on the Internet.  Stuff you think is simple might be hard.  Stuff you think is hard might be simple.  You have to worry about what order to teach, what skills you want the person to develop, and how you intend for them to learn them (frequent quizzing?).

As teachers, we are sometimes rather selfish about teaching.  How often do teachers even talk to each other about how to teach.  Over the years, I don't recall many conversations about how to teach.  We were basically left to our own devices on how to do that.  I recall someone who disagreed with how I wrote my tests.  I disagreed with her assessment, but we never really had a discussion on the topic.

And, a final reason it's hard to teach programming?  Not every ""complete beginner"" is the same.  This is perhaps the biggest fallacy beginners have.  Your lack of knowledge of programming may not be the same as someone else's because they may have a much bigger potential to learn it quickly compared to you, despite knowing very little about it.

The other fallacy is there is somehow a best book or best tutorial.  That's mostly from the tyranny of choice.  When there are so many choices, we fear making a bad decision.  We hope there is a ""best"" out there that will somehow make it easy when others do not, and that also likely doesn't happen.

Finally, learning programming on your own is tough.  You can't easily ask questions.  You don't get feedback or structure.  You're making a lot of decisions about how best to proceed.  There isn't someone putting external pressure to make you get things done.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many years ago, I taught programming for a few years, at the college intro level in computer science.  I took a break, and tried it once again about ten years ago, for a year.  Since then, mostly in software development land.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently, there was a post about why beginner tutorials are bad.  Let me relate a story in reaction to that.  About 15 years ago, Ruby on Rails was perhaps at its height, and I attended a conference of sort called &amp;quot;No Fluff Just Stuff&amp;quot;.  The idea was to have a traveling band of speakers who would talk about anything that wasn&amp;#39;t Microsoft.  Ruby on Rails fit the bill (Java and Javascript was also popular then, as well as agile, etc).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One speaker making the rounds was Dave Thomas.  If you&amp;#39;re old enough, he was the Wendy&amp;#39;s guy (only, he wasn&amp;#39;t).  If not, maybe you know him as Pragmatic Programmer guy, and certainly, he did a lot to popularize Ruby.  I think he helped translate a Ruby book in Japanese (or at least, some approximation of a translation) into English, and that helped its popularity outside of Japan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While most of his talks were about building apps for Ruby on Rails, he gave one talk about the differing levels of expertise from novice (complete beginner) to expert.  Experts, he noted (much like the guy commenting on beginner tutorials), tend to talk at a high level in shorthand to one another, and this isn&amp;#39;t good for beginners.  He related a story of where he was a beginner (in flying airplanes) and made rookie mistakes which his instructor warned him about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Point is, most people who want to create a tutorial know their audience are beginners.

I am very familiar with Java, some 3rd party libraries not as much but I am willing to learn if it's needed, I have basic knowledge with html/CSS (but I would prefer to not use it), I made a few little projects in python and c++ and I have a spare arduino and some parts for that (if you want to know more about what parts I have, please ask, I don't want to bloat this post with an unnecessary parts list).
I already had an idea of an android app, where notifications get send like everyday 6am that says I love you or something, but I haven't made anything more than buttons in android I soon gave up on that task. If you have any ideas on what I could do, please let me know and if you need to know anything more than feel free to ask me. Thanks already :)

Thank you so much for taking time to read this and hopefully help me out. I have created a react native project and I am using google places autocomplete and react-navigation. On the (Home) page the user will type in the Text Input field the name of a place. Once the place is clicked it will navigate them to the next screen which is (CheckIn). I would like for the place that the user selected to appear on the screen on my (checkIn) page. Everything is working but the place that the user selected is not appearing on the screen. I am trying to export a variable from the (home) screen and import the same variable on the (CheckIn) screen. I am trying to set the variable with the user input and I am having a hard time figuring it out. I keep getting a blank screen. Here is my code for both screens....

I don't have issues with finding the correct syntax to do what I need to do, that's simple enough. I'm more concerned with the thought process that goes into creating an efficient database as well as security measures to help mitigate the potential damage a hacker could cause.

I'm newish to the whole database thing. The most experience I've had with one is using Microvellum which is a program built for cabinet shops. It works on top of AutoCAD in tandem with a SQL database of mathematical formulae and various solid models to create 3d shop drawings, machine code, and other documents used in the production of cabinets. From that experience I have a general idea of how a database is structured, however, my knowledge is so rudimentary that I don't know what I don't know, nor where to start looking to get what may seem as obvious answers to some of you.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To begin, I know I'll have a table for users containing pertinent information such as username, password hash, salt, first name / last name, DoB, address, and other various information that affects the way the website is displayed.

My first question is regarding salt. I've seen that salt doesn't need to be encrypted, however, what I don't understand is if the attacker has the entire database, wouldn't the salt be useless as the attacker can use it to decrypt the stored passwords? What measures can be taken to make it more difficult for the attacker to decrypt passwords when salt is stored in plain text?

Second, I realize that the biggest factor in attacks is the actual code that is written, however, will having a separate permissions table that uses a foreign key referencing the user table provide better security over having the permission level stored in a column on the user table, or is that thought process falling for the ""security through obscurity"" fallacy?

Third, I've decided to not store any credit/debit card information, nor process payments through my servers at all due to security concerns and will instead use third party applications to perform the above tasks. In theory, this will reduce the perceived value of my database towards hackers, correct?

Moving on, I'll have several types of images I'll need to store in my database, user images, product images, article/blog/forum post, and images provided by sponsored artists for use in the media player. I will have the most control over the product and sponsored artist images, and their quantity won't be expanding nearly as rapidly as the others. Would it behoove me to create a separate table for each category of images, for the sole purpose of improving query speed, or would the only benefit be the added organization?

Let's also say that I don't want the server's file system to be visible from the outside, so, no right clicking ""view image"" via javascript, setting up .htaccess rules, and serving images and media via PHP. Would it be better for me to store the actual images and audio in the database and query for them directly, or would it be better to store a file name and extension in the database that would then be passed to a get command?

Finally, and this is extremely subjective, how do you know when you are, and how do you prevent yourself from over complicating your database?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just to preface this, I&amp;#39;m building a website for my business and I need to create a database, however I&amp;#39;m unsure on where to start.

From that experience I have a general idea of how a database is structured, however, my knowledge is so rudimentary that I don&amp;#39;t know what I don&amp;#39;t know, nor where to start looking to get what may seem as obvious answers to some of you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To begin, I know I&amp;#39;ll have a table for users containing pertinent information such as username, password hash, salt, first name / last name, DoB, address, and other various information that affects the way the website is displayed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My first question is regarding salt. I&amp;#39;ve seen that salt doesn&amp;#39;t need to be encrypted, however, what I don&amp;#39;t understand is if the attacker has the entire database, wouldn&amp;#39;t the salt be useless as the attacker can use it to decrypt the stored passwords? What measures can be taken to make it more difficult for the attacker to decrypt passwords when salt is stored in plain text?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, I realize that the biggest factor in attacks is the actual code that is written, however, will having a separate permissions table that uses a foreign key referencing the user table provide better security over having the permission level stored in a column on the user table, or is that thought process falling for the &amp;quot;security through obscurity&amp;quot; fallacy?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, I&amp;#39;ve decided to not store any credit/debit card information, nor process payments through my servers at all due to security concerns and will instead use third party applications to perform the above tasks. In theory, this will reduce the perceived value of my database towards hackers, correct?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moving on, I&amp;#39;ll have several types of images I&amp;#39;ll need to store in my database, user images, product images, article/blog/forum post, and images provided by sponsored artists for use in the media player. I will have the most control over the product and sponsored artist images, and their quantity won&amp;#39;t be expanding nearly as rapidly as the others. Would it behoove me to create a separate table for each category of images, for the sole purpose of improving query speed, or would the only benefit be the added organization?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s also say that I don&amp;#39;t want the server&amp;#39;s file system to be visible from the outside, so, no right clicking &amp;quot;view image&amp;quot; via javascript, setting up .htaccess rules, and serving images and media via PHP. Would it be better for me to store the actual images and audio in the database and query for them directly, or would it be better to store a file name and extension in the database that would then be passed to a get command?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, and this is extremely subjective, how do you know when you are, and how do you prevent yourself from over complicating your database?&lt;/p&gt;

I work for a help desk for a fortune 500 company.  We take inbound calls and when its slow we do outbound calls to existing tickets.

&amp;#x200B;

Well theres a problem: we're understaffed. We get tons of call spikes, our sla sucks, we have abandoned calls because people get tired of holding. Obv the solution is hire more people and better training. Well im not a manager and I dont see that happening.

So my help desk has adopted ""triaging"". Answer the call, get call back info, tell them we'll call back when the queue dies down, hang up and do it again. We've dedicated 3 people to doing the call backs and 4 people to triaging the calls.

&amp;#x200B;

We're dropping the ball on this. Some people are never getting called back. We use a crappy skype whiteboard to log all of the calls we need to call back and it can only be edited by one person at a time. Some of my co workers are morons and some how they delete the entire whiteboard so the entire list is gone. Some of the call back abuse their role and they just sit around for like 5-10 minutes pretending to do something before they actually call the user back.

&amp;#x200B;

I know theres a million ways to solve this, and probably a lot easier too. But like I said I want to learn development and I already have my approach to resolving this.

Create a web app that us triagers and call backers can log into.

Triagers fill out a form with name, location, contact number and issue. When they submit the form it posts to a table we can see. There will be a button next to the entry on the table to remove it from the ""needs to be called back"" table, and puts it in my own private ""im calling them back"" table.

To conserve space the table only shows limited info but when you click on the entry, it pops up the entire form on top of the web page as read only and blurs the background so you have the form in a full screen view.

When someone submits a ""needs to be called"" entry, it adds +1 to their count. Same for when someone else clicks ""Ill call them back""

This is to show whos doing work and whos not. Some people blow through the triage calls and other people take their sweet time.  person A might have taken 70 calls while person B has taken 30 calls. As well as the call back people. Person A might have done 43 call backs today while person B might have sat around picking their nose and done 12 call backs.

I also want a listener running that paints a pie chart on the page showing common calls and trends.  We might get 4 password reset calls and 40 broken app calls. So the pie chart can query the issues and search for key words like ""password"" or ""app 3.1 slow"" and then show the top 3 triaged calls like ""44 total calls &gt; 9% PW reset 74% broken APP 3.1 17% markdown"" and updates in real time.

Is this too complex for someone barely learning? I dont really know html or css or javascript. I wanted to learn python and flask instead. I know enough about SQL to do queries in SSMS and invoke-sqlcmd on powershell but thats it for the DB. I dont wanna spend 9 months on it because who knows by then maybe it wont even be an issue.

If im understanding right though its mostly just a GUI with array manipulation and some data analytics and reading/writing to a DB","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I want to learn programming and I already have my project idea.&lt;/p&gt;

This is code for a linked list queue in python provided by my professor so please correct me if I'm wrong.

    class Queue :
    
        def __init__( self ):
            self._qhead = None
            self._qtail = None

      def __init__( self, item ):

        def enqueue( self, item ): 
            node = _QueueNode( item )
            if self.is_empty() :

           self._qtail = node                # what does this line do?
           self._count += 1

Based on my understanding in the if statement, if nothing is in the queue, then the item will become the head of the linked list / the very first item of the queue. Otherwise, whatever the end / tail of the queue is, the pointer of that node will now point to the new item node. I just can't visualize what the `self._qtail = node` does to this linked list queue

        def dequeue( self ):
            assert not self.is_empty(), ""Cannot dequeue from an empty queue.""
            node = self._qhead

            self._count -= 1
            return node.item 

Similarly, in the dequeue method it obviously cannot remove anything from an empty linked list so this code will assert an error. Because queues are FIFO, that means the very first element (in a regular list) / the head of the linked list, will be the one that is removed, so I understand the need to set up a node variable to be returned at the end of this method.

I have an XSD file from which I am supposed to generate an xml file. I generated a class of the XSD using the xsd.exe tool and included that class in my project. I then instantiated the ('complextypes' in the XSD file) which contains the fields, etc.

For example,

    Dim dec As New AFRDeclaration
    dec.AccountID = ""ADCBAS""
    dec.Declaration = New AFRDeclarationType
    dec.Declaration.BillAdditionalDocument = New AFRBillAdditionalDocument
    dec.Declaration.BillAdditionalDocument.ReporterID = ""1234""

**AFRDeclaration** is the root element and **AFRDeclarationType** is contained within **AFRDeclaration. AFRDeclarationType** contains other table names.

However I am not being able to instantiate a certain table name called Container List

    dec.Declaration.ContainerList(1) = new AFRContainer

When I hover my text cursor over at ContainerList in intellisense, ContainerList is described as \[**property AFRDeclarationType.ContainerList As AFRContainer()\]**.

How do I instantiate the AFRContainer?

I am programming the board game *Mastermind* in Python and have hit a wall. I will explain the rules of the game, explain where I got stuck, and post my code underneath.

**Basic Rules**

Mastermind works by having one player, the codemaker, create a 4-digit code. The second player, or codebreaker, tries to break the code. In this program, the computer is the codemaker and the user is the codebreaker. Originally the code was based on colors, but I use integers because it's easier for the computer.

The codebreaker makes a guess, and the codemaker gives them feedback. A black peg represents a digit in the guess being at the exact right spot in the code. A white peg represents a digit in the guess being in the code, but not in the right spot.

**Where I'm Stuck**

I can't figure out how to get an accurate count of the white pegs. Apart from that, everything seems to be working. I tried only adding to white when guess\[i\] in code and guess\[i\] != code\[i\]. This caused false positives. For examples, if guess was \[1, 1, 1, 1\] and code was \[1, 2, 3, 4\], each of those 1s would unnecesarily add 1 to whites.

My second approach was to create a list identical to code, then replace any items in the identical list with 0 if they added to black or white. When I changed a value in the identical list, it would also change that value in the original list. I thought this was weird and don't understand why.

In conclusion, I need help evaluating the correct number of white pegs.

**My Code**

The entirety of my code is below. Please let me know if I can write anything more clearly or legibly.

    from random import *
    
    # makes code
    code = []
    for i in range(4):
      code.append(randint(1,4))
    
    # sets a for loop to run the game for ten turns
    for i in range(10):
      
    # takes guess, turns it into a list of ints for easy comparison with code
      guess = input()
      guess = guess.split('.')
      guess = list(map(int, guess))
    
    # determines number of black and white pegs
      black = 0
      white = 0
    
      for i in range(len(code)):
        var = code
    
        if guess[i] == var[i]:
          black += 1
          var[i] = 0
        if guess[i] in code and guess[i] != code[i]:

In this slide: [The online slide](http://ad-teaching.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/route-planning-ss2012/lecture-7.pdf), on page 16 (Node ordering 3/3, the second image), why isn't a path added from the very first non-contracted node to the 8th contracted node when node 7 is contracted? Because both are not contracted yet, shouldn't a path be added inbetween them? I can only think of one reasoning behind this: Because a shortcut from 7 to 8 already exists when node 6 was contracted and that the non-contracted node actually has a priority of 0 because it has no incoming nodes?

Additionally, in larger graphs, is there a way to limit the number of shortcuts added to later nodes? If the example shown above is expanded to 1M+ nodes, there would eventually exist nodes with hundreds of incoming shortcuts, which doesn't seem efficient at all. (Node 8 in the example already has 3 with just 9 nodes). In most real life cases, adding a shortcut would mean adding it both ways. Running a one way Dijkstra's search for each u-v-w set when there are hundreds of shortcuts will be very inefficient.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not sure if this belongs here but I am trying to implemented a &lt;a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contraction_hierarchies""&gt;CH algorithm&lt;/a&gt; and I am having trouble understanding the contraction process. &lt;/p&gt;

In this slide: &lt;a href=""http://ad-teaching.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/route-planning-ss2012/lecture-7.pdf""&gt;The online slide&lt;/a&gt;, on page 16 (Node ordering 3/3, the second image), why isn&amp;#39;t a path added from the very first non-contracted node to the 8th contracted node when node 7 is contracted? Because both are not contracted yet, shouldn&amp;#39;t a path be added inbetween them? I can only think of one reasoning behind this: Because a shortcut from 7 to 8 already exists when node 6 was contracted and that the non-contracted node actually has a priority of 0 because it has no incoming nodes?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, in larger graphs, is there a way to limit the number of shortcuts added to later nodes? If the example shown above is expanded to 1M+ nodes, there would eventually exist nodes with hundreds of incoming shortcuts, which doesn&amp;#39;t seem efficient at all. (Node 8 in the example already has 3 with just 9 nodes). In most real life cases, adding a shortcut would mean adding it both ways. Running a one way Dijkstra&amp;#39;s search for each u-v-w set when there are hundreds of shortcuts will be very inefficient.&lt;/p&gt;

so I'm not sure if the production env code in my server.js is an issue, but basically, upon deploying, my react frontend loads up fine, but none of the api calls to my backend are reaching, and all I'm getting is a 504 gateway timeout. I've read somewhere that it might be because I'm importing the root directory and not the build folder for react but the react seems to be working fine so I'm not sure.

I've set up a proxy as in the react side so I thought it would automatically swap my localhost calls from localhost:5000/api/artefact to [myapp.herokuapp.com/api/artefact](https://myapp.herokuapp.com/api/artefact) but it just comes up with an error:  
`Error occured while trying to proxy to:` [`myapp.herokuapp.com/api/artefact`](https://static-family.herokuapp.com/api/artefact)

    module.exports = app =&gt; {
        app.use(proxy(""/api/"", { target: ""http://localhost:5000"" }));

    const dbRoute = mongo_uri;

    app.use(""/api"", artefactRoutes);

    }
    
    app.listen(PORT, () =&gt;

and my api calls are like:

    const getDataFromDb = async () =&gt; {
        try {
            const data = await axios.get(""/api/artefact"");
            return data.data.artefacts;

Now I want to share a public version of what I've been working on - [the website](https://cauldron.app/).

It's a website that stores ""challenges"" - a better way to learn tech skills and apply to great jobs. What we do is we speak with some of the best tech people in the field and get their insight on how a valuable team member should look like skill-wise. We then structure that information in a perfect split of:

* The **tech stack** (languages, frameworks, libraries)
* Best **resources** to learn those
* Awesome **projects** to build for your engineering portfolio

The vision is for all companies to have their own custom ""challenges"" and hire talent in that way. Instead of going through the hassle of CVs and phone calls - they could just directly interview the most promising candidates based on their work.

Right now, we launched our [Android Developer Roadmap](https://cauldron.app/challenges/5d91b66731071f054f23f3ff), which was made with the help of more than 15 senior engineers. It doesn't have a job attached to it, but we're giving away **$100 Amazon cards** and will **personally assist** with finding a job to everyone who completes it!

I'm not a developer but I am learning and dabble a little in Golang. I thought this might be a reasonably achievable project that would also be useful to me (and probably many others if I can make it work.)

I'm new to programming and my teacher instructed me to create a Consoleapp that asks the user to type a sentence.

The  app should then return a result that shows how often each character from the sentence occurs.

Example:

User enters the sentence ""Hello world"". The console should show how often the letter ""H"" occurs, then the letter ""E"" and so on.

He also gave me a hint that I should search for ""string to char array"".

So of course I started searching online, but now I know how to convert the string to a char array. How do I use it to count how often each letter occurs?

I thought I did it correctly but then I was having a lot of weird issues. After debugging my code and running a few tests, it seems that the problem is coming from my misunderstanding of pointer arithmetic.

Say you have an array of pointers called *x and then you do x++, according to my book and my professor, all this does is go to the next memory location of the array (or the second index). But when I was using this in my code I was having problems and I ended up testing some stuff.

I made a loop that just printed out the first index of the pointer array and then do a x++ like this;

Do this loop 10 times{
   cout &lt;&lt; x[0] &lt;&lt;endl;
   X++;
}

Now from my understanding this should just print out the memory location of the first index of the pointer array, however what actually happened is that it printed the first memory location, then added 4 to it, which I guess makes since when the array is storing 4 byte integers and doing the ++ is supposed to increment it by the number of bytes for that data type.

However, shouldn't the statement 
   cout &lt;&lt; x[0]
Keep outputting the first memory location? I don't understand why the increment operator is increasing the memory location of the first index, and because of this, the rest of my program isn't working as expected.

So, I have a list of events that people can apply to. The events are stored in a table like this:

`other_events (eventID, event_name, event_description, max_no_of_people, date, active, created_by)`

When someone signs up for an event, there is the event\_applied table:

`event_applied (id, eventID, userID, date_applied)`

And now, here is the code which lists out all the events that are available to sign up for - the SQL query filters out the ones a user has already applied for:

`$sql = ""SELECT e.* FROM other_events e LEFT JOIN event_applied ea ON ea.eventID = e.eventID AND ea.userID = ? WHERE ea.eventID IS NULL AND e.active=1 ORDER BY datum asc;"";`

    if($stmt = $mysqli-&gt;prepare($sql)) 
                  {
                    $stmt-&gt;bind_param(""i"", $userID);
                    $stmt-&gt;execute(); 
                    $stmt-&gt;store_result();

                          &lt;/thead&gt;

                      echo '
                        &lt;tr&gt;

                          &lt;td&gt;'.$event_name.'&lt;/td&gt;

The question is now - since I'm hiding events that you already applied to, how can I hide the events that have a max number of people applied already? 

I tried with subqueries, but no luck :(

I know I have to count for each event in event\_applied table based on how many times eventID is written, and that would be the number of participants, but I just can't figure out how to do it.

I'm not used to Reddit, and I'm not English/American either, so please forgive me for both my poor English and maybe if this post is inappropriate.

Imagine that you receive a certain number of messages - you don't know how much you will receive, but you'll know when you have received all of them. You then want to choose one randomly, with equiprobability for each message to be chosen  (1).

However, in order to save both the Earth and your computer's memory, you don't want to keep every message in memory. How would you do ?

I tried 2 different ways ; none of them works, but it could spare people some time :

1) When receiving the k-th message, you keep it with a probabilty h(k). When you have received every message, you count how much messages you did receive (not how much you kept) and call this number N.

You then choose this message amongst all the others you kept with a probability g(N,k) verifying sum\[g(N,k)\] for k in range(N+1) = 1. In order to also verify (1), you also want that, for every k : h(k)\*g(N,k) = 1/N

I think I then proved that these conditions lead to one unique solution : h(k) = 1 and g(N,k) ) 1/N for every k. Therefore, you have to keep in memory every message... Not a good solution.

2) When receiving the k-th message, you apply a Bernoulli test with a parameter h(k) to every message you kept before the k-th and to the k-th message, and you only keep each message in case of success. Therefore, every message is kept with a probability that depends of N, even if you don't know N at start ! Then, you search a function g(N,k) in order to chose one of the messages you kept - however, in this case again, you eventually find out that the only solution is to choose h(k)=1 for every k... Once again, a bad solution :(

Any idea?

Thanks you !","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello !&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not used to Reddit, and I&amp;#39;m not English/American either, so please forgive me for both my poor English and maybe if this post is inappropriate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imagine that you receive a certain number of messages - you don&amp;#39;t know how much you will receive, but you&amp;#39;ll know when you have received all of them. You then want to choose one randomly, with equiprobability for each message to be chosen  (1).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, in order to save both the Earth and your computer&amp;#39;s memory, you don&amp;#39;t want to keep every message in memory. How would you do ?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I tried 2 different ways ; none of them works, but it could spare people some time :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1) When receiving the k-th message, you keep it with a probabilty h(k). When you have received every message, you count how much messages you did receive (not how much you kept) and call this number N.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You then choose this message amongst all the others you kept with a probability g(N,k) verifying sum[g(N,k)] for k in range(N+1) = 1. In order to also verify (1), you also want that, for every k : h(k)*g(N,k) = 1/N&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think I then proved that these conditions lead to one unique solution : h(k) = 1 and g(N,k) ) 1/N for every k. Therefore, you have to keep in memory every message... Not a good solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2) When receiving the k-th message, you apply a Bernoulli test with a parameter h(k) to every message you kept before the k-th and to the k-th message, and you only keep each message in case of success. Therefore, every message is kept with a probability that depends of N, even if you don&amp;#39;t know N at start !

I've been lurking here for a while and have tried to find something to explain my issue, but have been unsuccessful.  Recently I started doing [Microsoft's C# tutorials](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/tutorials/) and have hit a bit of a snag.  In the tutorial for ""List Collection"" there's a section that deals with integer lists. The code they have you type is as follows:

**var fibonacciNumbers = new List&lt;int&gt; {1, 1};**

**var previous = fibonacciNumbers[fibonacciNumbers.Count - 1];**

**var previous2 = fibonacciNumbers[fibonacciNumbers.Count - 2];**

**fibonacciNumbers.Add(previous + previous2);**

**foreach(var item in fibonacciNumbers)**
   

**Console.WriteLine(item);**

Now I understand most of what's happening here and the output will be 1, 1, 2 (1+1).  What I don't understand is what fibonacciNumbers.Count - 1 and fibonacciNumbers.Count - 2 do and the tutorial doesn't explain it.

 If I were to add a 3rd number to that array IE:

**var fibonacciNumbers = new List&lt;int&gt; {1, 4, 5}**

**var previous = fibonacciNumbers[fibonacciNumbers.Count - 1];**

**var previous2 = fibonacciNumbers[fibonacciNumbers.Count - 2];**

**fibonacciNumbers.Add(previous + previous2);**

**foreach(var item in fibonacciNumbers)**
   
**Console.WriteLine(item);**

The output is now 1, 4, 5, 9 (4+5) which to me doesn't make sense.  Arrays are supposed to start with 0 from what I understand so that would make sense why 1 and 2 would run 4 and 5 respectively , but if I were to try and do **fibonacciNumbers.Count - 0** it returns an exception and doesn't run the code so that means they aren't array index numbers.

Can someone please help me understand how that .Count works?  I've googled a bunch and can't figure it out.  I'm sorry if I'm not being completely clear on my question and can rephrase if needed. Thank you for any help.

I have been working on a pickup service project using Vue.js.  My project needs to identify and assign addresses that fall within predetermined zones.  So for example, a town may have communities or section that are miles apart, and at times, these internal communities can feature different zip codes or mailing address.  I need to identify these separate communities, and (eventually automatically) assign them a standard identifier, like a *zone*.

I did find something called Google Sharp Zoning in my searching.  I'd never heard of it until I found it and I can not find much of anything online detailing it.  If, it didn't reside on the [google.com](https://google.com) domain, I would have thought someone custom made this (yes, I know you can custom make with Google's domain to an extent).  Anyhoo, here is the link:

Something like the above link may just work for my needs, but I have no idea how it was done.

Moreover, after finding this solution, I still need to go a layer further and consider a *type* that is associated with the pickup and thus affects the days of the actual pickup for each zone.  Like if someone used the app to request a pickup for one type of thing, and then later in the day, from that same address, used the app again to request a pickup for a different type of thing, the next pickup would still be assigned to the same address and zone, but the actual day of the pickup would change.

My programming with Javascript/Vue.js is still at a what I'd call a beginner/intermediate stage.  For some context, I do have a crud system with authentication via firebase/firestore in place.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/viewer?msa=0&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;t=m&amp;amp;ll=34.092402%2C-84.31174299999998&amp;amp;spn=0.021324%2C0.025749&amp;amp;z=14&amp;amp;source=embed&amp;amp;mid=13O1wvt_ZdIEvTM1plXHFeYeNxEA""&gt;https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/viewer?msa=0&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;t=m&amp;amp;ll=34.092402%2C-84.31174299999998&amp;amp;spn=0.021324%2C0.025749&amp;amp;z=14&amp;amp;source=embed&amp;amp;mid=13O1wvt_ZdIEvTM1plXHFeYeNxEA&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Something like the above link may just work for my needs, but I have no idea how it was done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, after finding this solution, I still need to go a layer further and consider a &lt;em&gt;type&lt;/em&gt; that is associated with the pickup and thus affects the days of the actual pickup for each zone.  Like if someone used the app to request a pickup for one type of thing, and then later in the day, from that same address, used the app again to request a pickup for a different type of thing, the next pickup would still be assigned to the same address and zone, but the actual day of the pickup would change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My programming with Javascript/Vue.js is still at a what I&amp;#39;d call a beginner/intermediate stage.  For some context, I do have a crud system with authentication via firebase/firestore in place. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you for any assistance on this topic, its been bugging me for quite some time.&lt;/p&gt;

I am currently trying to merge several data frames in pandas and cannot seem to figure out the correct way of doing so. I am currently extracting data from excel workbooks using a “for” loop going through the list of my files. My ultimate goal is to be able to have the data in a structured format where I can plot the lines from the different files. The data being pulled is relatively simple the issue is how to properly merge the files. Because there is over 7 files I am not sure how I would approach this. Below is a sample of how the data will look in the workbook.

This is my code I am running to do both extraction of the data and creating the dataframe, any suggestions? Each iteration returns data from a workbook contained in the list, and I am currently trying to think of a different way of approaching this. Also I was wondering if there is a way to actually create different dataframe names based on the current iteration of the loop. It would certainly help to be able to just actually name the df after the file being used in the loop list. I have commented out both ways I have tried to do this. 

for i in dfList : 

s3 = boto3.client('s3', aws\_access\_key\_id=aws\_id, aws\_secret\_access\_key=aws\_secret)

obj = s3.get\_object(Bucket=bucket\_name, Key= i)

i =pd.DataFrame()

data = obj\['Body'\].read()

i = pd.read\_excel(io.BytesIO(data), encoding='utf-8', header=None, skiprows = 12, usecols =(""A,B""))

i.columns = \['Date','Values'\]

\#masterdf = masterdf.append(i,ignore\_index=True)

\#mdatabase= i.merge(i, on='Date', how= ""outer"")

\#print(masterdf)

print(i)

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Sample of the data in the workbooks below. Another issue is the dates change

1/1/2019	1000		6/1/2019	2300

I am currently extracting data from excel workbooks using a “for” loop going through the list of my files. My ultimate goal is to be able to have the data in a structured format where I can plot the lines from the different files. The data being pulled is relatively simple the issue is how to properly merge the files. Because there is over 7 files I am not sure how I would approach this. Below is a sample of how the data will look in the workbook.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is my code I am running to do both extraction of the data and creating the dataframe, any suggestions? Each iteration returns data from a workbook contained in the list, and I am currently trying to think of a different way of approaching this. Also I was wondering if there is a way to actually create different dataframe names based on the current iteration of the loop. It would certainly help to be able to just actually name the df after the file being used in the loop list. I have commented out both ways I have tried to do this. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;for i in dfList : &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;s3 = boto3.client(&amp;#39;s3&amp;#39;, aws_access_key_id=aws_id, aws_secret_access_key=aws_secret)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;obj = s3.get_object(Bucket=bucket_name, Key= i)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i =pd.DataFrame()&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;data = obj[&amp;#39;Body&amp;#39;].read()&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i = pd.read_excel(io.BytesIO(data), encoding=&amp;#39;utf-8&amp;#39;, header=None, skiprows = 12, usecols =(&amp;quot;A,B&amp;quot;))&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i.columns = [&amp;#39;Date&amp;#39;,&amp;#39;Values&amp;#39;]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;#masterdf = masterdf.append(i,ignore_index=True)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;#mdatabase= i.merge(i, on=&amp;#39;Date&amp;#39;, how= &amp;quot;outer&amp;quot;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;#print(masterdf)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;print(i)&lt;/p&gt;

Because `fs.writeFile` writes over the file, I am trying to first read the file into some sort of object or possibly an array, then append the POST data into that object / array, then write *that* new data into the JSON file. This way I can achieve appending.

It doesn't work, however. The first time this is ran, the JSON file is empty, and so `let json = JSON.parse(data)` will be empty, or something. But that's probably not the culprit, it's most likely the next line, which I can't figure out how to fix.

So to my understanding, the 'this' keyword in C++ is a reference to the object we're using, or something. I think it's like 'self' in Python.

The thing is, whenever I create classes in C++, I find myself not using 'this', and I feel like it's fine, but I have a feeling that it's better to use it.

So let me give some examples:

Let's say I want to create a class Cat. 

Cat.h

    class Cat {
    
    public: 
    Cat();
    Cat(string br, string f, string e, int a);
    void scratch();
    void meow();
    void purr();
    void yowl();
    
    private: 
    string breed, fur_color, eye_color;
    int age;
    };

To my understanding, I could implement the non-default constructor in one of two ways:

    Cat::Cat(string br, string f, string e, int a) {
        breed = br;
        fur_color = f;
        eye_color = e;
        age = a;
    }
    Cat::Cat(string br, string f, string e, int a) {
        this.breed = br;
        this.fur_color = f;
        this.eye_color = e;
        this.age = a;
    }

I'm fascinated by programming, and all the applications that software development presents. I have always coded a little bit in my spare time, but have never really gotten around to finish a programming book, or building anything from scratch.

I have a feeling, that you cannot become a good programmer without also enjoying the theoretical/almost academic side of the field.

I know that ""programming"" is a pretty broad term, where I figure that web-development/front-end development is the least theory-heavy field. However, fields like analytics/AI/ML seem to be only for those, with a deep theoretical understanding of the programming-discipline.

My life is currently at a place, where a career change might be relevant, and I would love to work with code. However, I'm not in a place where I can take an education, and I cannot self-learn the many hardcore theories required to understand complex math or statistics. 

However, I can grind, and I feel like there might be a part of this industry, where I can do a good job, without being a self-taught scientist.

**My final two questions would be these:**

* Do you agree with the idea, that good software developers must also enjoy complex theory?
* Which field can I attempt at getting good at, without diving into complex theories (I'm thinking CSS/JS and front-end?)?

Maybe I'm just plain wrong. Hopefully, someone can add some perspective to this discussion. Thanks in advance.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi everyone&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have been learning C# for the past 3 weeks. Right now, I am trying to incorporate a chart from ChartJS into my web app and I am stuck. When I entered the code and ran the app, the page just sits there with the loading cursor. I was never shown the dashboard, which is where my graphics are suppose to be. Can somebody tell me what may be wrong? Any help or leads are appreciated from this newbie.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am suppose to be creating a &lt;a href=""https://www.chartjs.org/samples/latest/charts/scatter/multi-axis.html""&gt;scatter multi axis chart&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is the &lt;a href=""https://github.com/chartjs/Chart.js/blob/master/samples/charts/scatter/multi-axis.html""&gt;repo&lt;/a&gt; I was following from ChartJs.&lt;/p&gt;

Experts are too far gone from being a junior that they don’t remember what it’s like and therefore struggle to relate to the challenges/problems juniors face. However what’s really going on here?

The neuroscience behind it is this. 

Experts chunk information. Which is to say they take lots of little bits and piece it together into large meaningful bits of information and they use these large bits to think about problems and solutions at a much higher level. 

You see, your working memory is very limited and so if you try to think about ever piece individually you’d get overwhelmed. If you van chunk all this information so you only think of 4/5 pieces but huge pieces which contain much information inside them then you can prevent getting overwhelmed while still taking on more cognitive load.

A real life example is think of a chef who’s teaching an apprentice cook. He may say things like “sauté the vegetable until done” or “mix sauce until good consistency”. It makes sense to the master chef but not to the apprentice cook. What does it mean that the vegatables are done? What is good consistency? There’s a lot of assumed knowledge because the expert isn’t thinking of every little step, he’s thinking in big chunks.

Chunking is a skill only available to experts. In order to chunk you must be very experienced and familiar with the knowledge. It’s only knowing the deep relationships between things when you can see how they fit bigger elements.

So what does this all mean? 

What it means is every course, tutorial, video made by an expert is missing steps. They are all assuming lots of knowledge in the audience which often doesn’t exist.

The kicker is this, experts have something called unconscious competence. They don’t know they’re skipping steps, they don’t even recognise anymore that there’s smaller steps in between. Juniors suffer here because they have unconscious incompetence - they don’t know what they don’t know. 

So basically here we have both sides who don’t realise there’s crucial information that’s being missed out and all we get is juniors being confused or not totally understating things but not being sure why or how to solve it.

Therefore the solution is for juniors to slow down when taking these courses. You’ll have to go slowly, pause often and think about each step. Try to figure out what assumed knowledge might be there and google to see what’s missing. It’s slow and boring but entirely necessary 

TL:DR - experts skip steps in their thinking which leads to many component steps being missed out in courses/videos etc. Juniors will get confused by this and not learn all the steps they need do. Therefore juniors need to slow down, pause often and google things which don’t make complete sense

&lt;p&gt;Also any advice for a complete beginner in the field? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anything helps, thank you! :)&lt;/p&gt;

&amp;#x200B;

Firstly for context, my team is going for the ICPC Topi Regional Competition, 2019! I'm a sophomore, so is the rest of my team, and I still can't believe it we made it so far. I'm just glad.

Secondly, to prepare for the next coming rounds, I have been going around online, looking at popular algorithms, specific problems that relate to one type of data structure, trying to simply develop the logic because I don't have the time to code it all, and trying my best to make room to go and ask my instructors about how some things work.

But I still feel quite slow. 

I'm able to give some 3-4 hours per week, and I find that too little. I hardly manage to do more than 4-5 problems, and I feel like I can do more.

Everyday, 5 days a week, I travel by the University Bus, and spend about 2 hours coming and going. 

So I thought maybe I should keep tabs open and look at problems while on the bus, but trust me, staring at a laptop screen in a shaky bus, trying to concentrate, keeping your mind focused while you sit near the window because you don't want to be stuck on the side, or be in between two sleepy people isn't really the best way to clear your mind. I have been trying to master this talent for 2 years, only successful on rare days.

Mostly I see code, read some book relating to Data Structures, or watch some MIT OCW Data Structures lecture. But I feel that these are mostly geared and written for academic intentions, and not towards developing quick logic.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm really found of reading articles, and some articles on Medium I have found to be very direct and quick in explaining hard problems, but Medium is paid for, so... yeah, can't do that.

What other articles, blogs, or podcasts can you recommend me that focus solely on logic building, problem solving, and just interested in applying mathematics? I'm open to the idea of reading from my smart phone, maybe reading a hardcopy, or listening to a podcast as well.

    &gt; S Hugo Jasper
    &gt; S Laura Helena
    &gt; S Jasper Maria
    &gt; S Laura Elias

And if I were to query Hugo (Using P), I'll get the following.
    
    &gt; P Hugo
    Hugo
    ..Laura
    ....Helena

    ..Jasper

There are additional functionalities like get the depth/get the longest chain etc. 

Task 2 is fairly similar to this, but you read from a file that contains information about tram line. for e.g

    West;placeA
    East;placeB
    East;placeC
    East;placeD

The functionalities of this are, print all the tram lines, print tram lines that goes through a station, add a station, search a station etc etc. 

My question is what's a good data structure for this problem? I was thinking of using a graph, but are there any other alternatives out there?

    // table adminSettings
    payoutPaypal boolean
    payoutCheckByMail boolean

...and so on. Seems straightforward.

But in this design I do not know how to handle the ability to add custom payment methods. Say they wanted to offer a payout service I've never heard of: PayZonk. I could probably reason about the front end code. 

    &lt;form&gt;
      &lt;label&gt;Paypal&lt;/label&gt;

1. Make a table devoted to custom payout types. Columns would be: customServiceId, serviceName. I think that's it
2. Create a customServices column in the adminSettings table. Field type is either varchar, which must always be retrieved first as JSON, array pushed and restringified (sounds horrible), or using MySQL's array column type which I hear is also bad

workspace $","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello, everyone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am trying to create a project/recreate a weather program in Python using a OpenWeather API key and I am having issues interpreting the error message.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am following a YouTube video:  &lt;a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXTD9ePA8RI&amp;amp;t=119s""&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXTD9ePA8RI&amp;amp;t=119s&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- at ~3:50&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His directions are clear, I am just missing up at the part where I enter a city name and the country code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Code that drives the following error is this (Python 3.7):&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;import pyowm&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;#run owm = pyowm.OWM(&amp;#39;sudo pip3 install pyowm&amp;#39;) first&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;owm = pyowm.OWM(&amp;#39;e9c40c6cf96b4c39ba9d3db88ccae3c6&amp;#39;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;observation = owm.weather_at_place(&amp;#39;San Francisco, US&amp;#39;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;print(observation)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

For this assignment, you will write a program which creates an array  of decimal numbers from a user's input, then returns some simple  statistics about the array.

The program should first ask the user how long they wish the array to  be (must be a positive integer). If the user enters a non-positive  integer then the program should display ""Not a valid length!""  
,  then stop. Otherwise, the program should create an array of this  length, then prompt the user to enter double values one at a time,  filling the array from the start with the user's inputs until the array  is full.

Once the array is filled the program should print the numbers in the  array, followed by the average (arithmetic mean) of the values, the  range of the values, and a statement on whether the array is sorted in  increasing order, decreasing order or neither.

&amp;#x200B;

* The average of the values is found by dividing the sum of the  numbers by the amount of numbers in the array (note: this may cause  roundoff errors, which you do not need to worry about for this  assignment).
* The range of the numbers is found by subtracting the smallest number in the array from the largest number in the array.
* **The array is sorted in increasing order if every number is** **greater than or equal** **to the previous number. The array is sorted in decreasing order if every element is** **less than or equal**  **to the previous number. If neither of these is true then the list is  unsorted. If every element on the list is the same, then it is counted  as being in** **increasing order****.**

I've made several attempts and different versions of my code and none of them seem to ever work correctly. Of possible, could someone walk me through this last part/hint me on how to go about it.

~~Effectively, I want to create a map with UI elements that allows you to set what items you *currently* have, what items you've checked and what items you *can* check. I have no preference if it's just a map with tick boxes at the top for true/false items and it updates the map accordingly.~~

My goal: Set an image of the world map as a background, and then create UI elements of all of the things you can ""collect"" at certain X/Y positions on the map, with a hitbox covering the entire element. Preferably this map can also click/drag to look around, because the map for the game is quite large vertically If you click the hitbox, the element will grayscale with lowered opacity, signifying it's been collected. At the same time, since items are randomized, I need a separate UI for the things I've collected, which will show certain items on the map based on whether or not they're collectable with the items I have. There's a great website [here](https://scripterswar.com/hollowknight/randomizer) that has already done the majority of the logic work for me, so it's just a matter of putting it into practice in whatever language I use.

I've gotten my feet a little bit wet by making a really bad 2d platformer before, but it was really garbage and needed a lot of polish to get rid of some terrible (albeit funny) bugs. What language would be most appropriate to learn for this? I'm not asking in a ""which language is best"" way, but in a ""which language would be most efficient or be easiest to debug for this specific project"" kind of way.

Sorry if this is the wrong place to put this, r/coding and r/programming both have rules that state ""if your post has no code it probably doesn't belong here"".

My assignment for this week was to calculate the net and gross cost for phone calls using conditional statements. I was able to create a functioning code, but the problem also requires us to **use name constants so that the only number inside the int main() function is 2 (which I used for set precision).** How do I do this? Do I create a boolean variable on top of the int main() and have it set to the boolean expression? 

I .e.  bool NON\_BUSINESS = ((time &lt;= 800) &amp;&amp; (time &gt; 0)) || ((time &gt;= 1800) &amp;&amp; (time &lt;= 2400)).

and then in my int main() I can use: if (NON\_BUSINESS) ...

The same would go for the if (minutes &gt; 60) ...

Would something like this work? I have tried doing something similar in a different problem and it wouldn't work. It would just always set off my else condition no matter what I entered.

So, I'm nonetheless, just another person learning how to Program and write Code. I've primarily been learning Java and C and a bit of Python. But one question that I've had for sometime but has struck me again recently is whether I should learn C++.

I mean, if I know C and Java, then it shouldn't be too hard, right?

The reason I'm asking this is I've heard of all of the Criticism on C++. *It's bloated, it's slow when you run it and the Code that get's written in it is always messy*, you get the idea. Is this necessarily true? I mean, I know it's possible to write some decent looking Code with it but as a Program gets more complex, the Code is obviously going to start becoming messy overtime. But what about the *Slow* and *Bloated* bits? Are they true?

I don't want to learn a Language that is slow and bloated and can become messy. I'd prefer to learn a Language that is fast, not bloated and one that I can write some decent looking Code in, even if it's complex.

Another reason is Jobs. A lot of Companies nowadays use C++ for their Software and I'm worried that may interfere with my ability to get a Job if I don't learn the Language.

My question is about what differences are possible between a deprecated method and it’s current version. 

For example, I have a method, put, which puts an item in a hashtable. This method is implemented in a way that will always check to see if the item is already in the hashtable first and if it is, it does nothing. 

Say put becomes deprecated and a new method is made called putv. It must be guaranteed that putv puts an item into the hashtable, however is there a guarantee that putv must also check if the item is there first?

If I write a function that uses put I won’t use an if clause to see if the item is present since put does so, but what if I upgrade to putv?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;From my understanding, when methods are marked as “deprecated” it means that a new method with a new name has been made to replace that one and it is assumed that the deprecated method is somehow inferior or obsolete.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But these methods still exist and can be used, forever. &lt;/p&gt;

I'm working on a web app using JSF for school and I've run into a problem, I'm hoping for some guidance. I think part of the problem I don't fully understand how FacesContext works.

I have a page that displays a list of users, in this list there is an update button, which leads to a form that the user can use to update their information. I'm trying to get this form to be pre-populated with the user data. My teacher showed us an example of this by sending the userId as a parameter, creating the user object with the appropriate data by querying the database using this parameter, saving it in a map, which is part of FacesContext, and then populating the form from this map that is accessible from the new page (I think?) Here is my code.

**User List Page:**

You'll see near the bottom there is a link: `&lt;h:commandLink value=""Update"" styleClass=""button action-button"" action=""#{userController.loadUser(user.userId)}"" /&gt;` The method here sends the userId as a parameter.

**This is the loadUser() method inside UserController**

I've created logs in the console, so I can see that when the method begins, the userId is received. I can also see that when movieStoreDbUtil.getUser(userId); is invoked, the right data is pulled from the database and the new user object is correctly created. I can also see at the very end (right before the return statement, the new user IS put in the requestMap... but once the new page loads, all the form fields are empty :( we did a similar exercise in class and it was working properly. Any guidance?

    public String loadUser(int userId) {
    
    		logger.info(""\n\n ------------------------- loading User with Id: "" + userId + ""\n"");
    		
    		ExternalContext externalContext = FacesContext.getCurrentInstance().getExternalContext();
    		Map&lt;String, Object&gt; requestMap = externalContext.getRequestMap();
    		
    		try {
    			
    			User theUser = movieStoreDbUtil.getUser(userId);
    			
    			logger.info(""\n\n -------------------------\n user pulled from database:\n "" + theUser + ""\n\n"");
    		
    			requestMap.put(""user"", theUser);
    			
    		}
    		catch(Exception exc) {
    			logger.log(Level.SEVERE, ""\n\n -------------------------\n Error loading user id \n"" + userId + ""\n"", exc);
    			
    			addErrorMessage(exc);
    			
    			return null;
    		}
    		logger.info(""\n\n -------------------------\n REQUESTMAP: \n"" + requestMap.toString() + ""\n------------------------- \n\n"");
    		return ""update_user.xhtml"";
    		
    	}

 

**MovieStoreDbUtil getUser()**

I don't think the issue is in this method, but it is called from UserController.updateUser(), so I thought I should share the code.

    public User getUser(int theUserId) throws Exception {
    		
    		Connection myConn = null;
    		PreparedStatement myStmt = null;
    		ResultSet myRs = null;
    		
    		try {
    			myConn = getConnection();
    			
    			String sql = ""select * from users where userId=?"";
    			
    			myStmt = myConn.prepareStatement(sql);
    			
    			myStmt.setInt(1, theUserId);
    			
    			myRs = myStmt.executeQuery();
    			
    			//set variable to null before using it
    			User theUser = null;
    			
    			if(myRs.next()) {
    				int userId = myRs.getInt(""userId"");
    				String firstName = myRs.getString(""firstName"");
    				String lastName = myRs.getString(""lastName"");
    				String phone = myRs.getString(""phone"");
    				String address = myRs.getString(""address"");
    				String email = myRs.getString(""email"");
    				String username = myRs.getString(""username"");
    				String password = myRs.getString(""password"");
    				String updates = myRs.getString(""updates"");
    				String privacy = myRs.getString(""privacy"");
    				
    				theUser = new User(userId, firstName, lastName, phone, address, email, username, password, updates, privacy);
    			}
    			else {
    				throw new Exception(""Could not find user id "" + theUserId);
    			}
    			return theUser;
    		}
    		finally {
    			close(myConn, myStmt, myRs);
    		}

        &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;


    &amp;lt;/h:body&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/html&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This is the loadUser() method inside UserController&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve created logs in the console, so I can see that when the method begins, the userId is received. I can also see that when movieStoreDbUtil.getUser(userId); is invoked, the right data is pulled from the database and the new user object is correctly created. I can also see at the very end (right before the return statement, the new user IS put in the requestMap... but once the new page loads, all the form fields are empty :( we did a similar exercise in class and it was working properly. Any guidance?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;public String loadUser(int userId) {

        logger.info(&amp;quot;\n\n ------------------------- loading User with Id: &amp;quot; + userId + &amp;quot;\n&amp;quot;);

        ExternalContext externalContext = FacesContext.getCurrentInstance().getExternalContext();
        Map&amp;lt;String, Object&amp;gt; requestMap = externalContext.getRequestMap();

        try {

            User theUser = movieStoreDbUtil.getUser(userId);

            logger.info(&amp;quot;\n\n -------------------------\n user pulled from database:\n &amp;quot; + theUser + &amp;quot;\n\n&amp;quot;);

            requestMap.put(&amp;quot;user&amp;quot;, theUser);

        }
        catch(Exception exc) {
            logger.log(Level.SEVERE, &amp;quot;\n\n -------------------------\n Error loading user id \n&amp;quot; + userId + &amp;quot;\n&amp;quot;, exc);

            addErrorMessage(exc);

            return null;
        }
        logger.info(&amp;quot;\n\n -------------------------\n REQUESTMAP: \n&amp;quot; + requestMap.toString() + &amp;quot;\n------------------------- \n\n&amp;quot;);
        return &amp;quot;update_user.xhtml&amp;quot;;

    }
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MovieStoreDbUtil getUser()&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t think the issue is in this method, but it is called from UserController.updateUser(), so I thought I should share the code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;public User getUser(int theUserId) throws Exception {

        Connection myConn = null;
        PreparedStatement myStmt = null;

            String sql = &amp;quot;select * from users where userId=?&amp;quot;;

            myStmt = myConn.prepareStatement(sql);

            myStmt.setInt(1, theUserId);

            myRs = myStmt.executeQuery();

            //set variable to null before using it
            User theUser = null;

            if(myRs.next()) {
                int userId = myRs.getInt(&amp;quot;userId&amp;quot;);
                String firstName = myRs.getString(&amp;quot;firstName&amp;quot;);
                String lastName = myRs.getString(&amp;quot;lastName&amp;quot;);
                String phone = myRs.getString(&amp;quot;phone&amp;quot;);
                String address = myRs.getString(&amp;quot;address&amp;quot;);
                String email = myRs.getString(&amp;quot;email&amp;quot;);
                String username = myRs.getString(&amp;quot;username&amp;quot;);
                String password = myRs.getString(&amp;quot;password&amp;quot;);
                String updates = myRs.getString(&amp;quot;updates&amp;quot;);
                String privacy = myRs.getString(&amp;quot;privacy&amp;quot;);

                theUser = new User(userId, firstName, lastName, phone, address, email, username, password, updates, privacy);
            }
            else {
                throw new Exception(&amp;quot;Could not find user id &amp;quot; + theUserId);
            }
            return theUser;

        finally {

* Both the processes will have all the same code that follows the fork() call
* Both processes will begin execution on this first line *after* the call

Given my understanding, I was messing around trying to see this in application and was confused by the results of the following test:

I understand all the output that is there currently; the parent process will start at line 8, will have a positive value for variable ""ret_fork"", and fall into the if conditional. The child processes then starts also at line 8, but this is where I am confused.

**Why do the lines within the else statement not get executed for the child process? I am especially confused because when I print ""ret_fork"", it has a the value of 0, which should fall through to the else condition.** 

I looked at this yesterday and thought I was just tired, but am coming back today and still do not understand why this is the case. Any help would be appreciated, thanks!","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am trying to understand how the fork() system call works. Here is my understanding:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I know that when fork() is called, it will spawn two processes: the parent, and the child&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The value returned by fork() is positive for the parent, and 0 for the child. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Both the processes will have all the same code that follows the fork() call&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Both processes will begin execution on this first line &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; the call&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given my understanding, I was messing around trying to see this in application and was confused by the results of the following test:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;#include &amp;lt;stdio.h&amp;gt;
#include &amp;lt;sys/types.h&amp;gt;
#include &amp;lt;unistd.h&amp;gt;

int main()
{
    printf(&amp;quot;getpid(): %d\n&amp;quot;, getpid());
    int ret_fork = fork();
    const char *str = &amp;quot;M|Ms&amp;quot;;
    printf(&amp;quot;%s\n&amp;quot;, str);
    printf(&amp;quot;fork returned: %d\n&amp;quot;, ret_fork);
    printf(&amp;quot;getpid(): %d\n&amp;quot;, getpid());
    if (ret_fork != 0) {
        str = &amp;quot;Skittles&amp;quot;;
        printf(&amp;quot;%s\n&amp;quot;, str);
    }
    else {
        sleep(1);
        printf(&amp;quot;%s are the best\n&amp;quot;, str);
    }

}    
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The output is this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I am already having a problem generating random 5 digit number and sorting them in order. Random number and name needs to be generated in a function. And I have no idea how to do this. Because I switched universities and this new uni. uses C++ and I only study the basics of C# at my old uni.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wrote this so far but it didn&amp;#39;t work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;struct Student
{
    int id;
    float no;
    float grade;
}stu;


int main()
{
    int* ptr, amount;
    std::cout &amp;lt;&amp;lt; &amp;quot;Enter the Student amount:&amp;quot;;
    std::cin &amp;gt;&amp;gt; amount;
    ptr = new int[amount];

    std::cout &amp;lt;&amp;lt; &amp;quot;\nStudentNo.&amp;quot;;
    std::cout &amp;lt;&amp;lt; &amp;quot;\n------\n&amp;quot;;
    for (size_t i = 0; i &amp;lt; amount; i++)
    {
        stu.no = rand() % 10000;
        std::cout &amp;lt;&amp;lt; stu.no &amp;lt;&amp;lt; &amp;quot;\n&amp;quot;;
    }

    return 0;
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any help is appreciated. Thank you.&lt;/p&gt;

I mostly participate in writing spring\boot mvc applications to solve business tasks.

The question is about establishing an interaction:

1. Interaction between multiple services layers in same application.

2. Interaction between multiple applications including 3rd party application.

Example of an issue:
A typical guide usually demonstrates a simple application, like a package of models, package of repos, services, controllers, configs and that's nice. 

But what if application starts growing? 

Like over 30 services, how to decouple them? 

How decoupled services should speak to each other? messaging or any other ways? 

How to speak to 3rd party applications?

How to manage data access in case of concurrency?

Design patterns to solve business tasks? (aside from gof, to solve bigger tasks)

I know Java. I have worked in java and have solved online problems in java. I wouldn't say I am really well versed but, since in college we were doing stuff in java it made me comfortable in java. I never looked at any other language in college while solving coding problems.

Yes, I have used python but mostly for ML related stuff and not for solving competitive coding type of stuff.

In java I use functions like 'charAt()', 'toCharArray()', 'split()', 'substring()' and Frameworks like 'ArrayList', Queue &amp; Stack and stuff like that. There might be the equivalent of those functions and frameworks in C++ (which I'm not aware of yet) but I think it's more elegant and less cumbersome in Java.

I don't know C++ yet. I know C but don't code much in that. I use Java mostly.

I have read many article and posts where people specify the pros and cons of both the languages.

While STL is particularly useful in C++, Java has got BigInteger class(i dont see a lot of questions where i need BigInteger though). Thing is, since I'm now comfortable in Java and I need to start working on my coding skills, should i switch to C++ or stick to java? I can learn the basics of C++ and also implement stuff really fast, but I wont be as comfortable in the 'niche' of the language as i am in Java. Yeah with practice I can become comfortable in anything, but I need some realistic views and answers over here.

I may be mumbling bullshit here instead of actually working on with what I have got, but TLE is a bigger issue that BigInteger. C++ stuff on string handling isnt that elegant as it is on Java but, maybe I don't know it yet.

I'm in college right now and my placement is done too. Since i wanted to go for higher studies I left the job and have started preparing for higher studies so that i can get into a good college. I'm not so sure about doing a PhD as of now since it's a really big decision, but I want to do my Master at least.

I am mostly interested in getting a REALLY good job or going for a PhD (It's not very likely that I will opt for a PhD). I also know that it doesn't matter in what language you give the interview, but in order to get the interview I have to clear the initial rounds which requires time limit and stuff. I have failed doing that in Java a few times(Although at that time i was using ""Scanner"" class instead of BufferReader).

It's really verbose and I'm sorry for that. Thanks to anyone and everyone who went through my post. I need to stick to something.

**EDIT:** I can't choose both(first one then the other), I need to bet on one and only one language.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey guys&lt;/p&gt;

However, there are a few expressions I'm not sure how to convert into java code to see if they're valid or invalid. For example, 13 and 15 onwards I was confused about. Can someone assist me with completing the task? 

**TASK**

Write a new program that declares the following variables:

a = 100, b = 2.3, c = -52.2, d = true, e = ""I am "",

f = ""a student"", g = 0, h = '!'. 

Declare the following constants, pi = 3.142 and name = &lt;your name&gt;. 

Make sure you use the correct types. 

Declare three more variables, x as a long, y as a double and z as a String. Where possible use the expression shorthand notation. Where there are two expressions per exercise, these should be completed sequentially within the program. 

Compute and display the following expressions, determine which ones are valid and work out why the invalid expressions are wrong. Verify your results using the Windows *Calculator*. Add **comments** where appropriate to remind you of what you have done and what your program does.

So I know there are a lot of similar questions to this on reddit and I’ve spent some time trawling through them. However, I wanted to ask for some specific advice regarding my situation.

I graduated with a Computer Science degree about 20 years ago and spent about 3 years in programming related jobs. However, after that my career path took me rapidly away from programming. I trained to be a teacher, taught for 3 years and then moved into education quality assurance.

About 10 years ago I became ill and had to stop working. I am now at the point where I can work full-time again and am looking at my options. One of the things I have realised is that I would like to revisit programming as a career. My motivations for this are:

* **The potential to work abroad.** My wife and I are based in the UK and 	my illness has prevented us from doing many things, one of which is travelling. We would both like to work abroad (Canada, Sweden, Norway?) and based on what I’ve read, a career in programming is an ideal way to do this due to the fact that many countries are desperate for trained IT professionals.  
 
* **Financial rewards.** I’ve been unable to earn anything significant for 10 years and that sucks. My wife has shouldered the responsibility for keeping us financially afloat during that time and now I want to take some of that responsibility back. Programming is well-payed, even in entry-level positions.  
 
* **Unfinished business.** This is the big one. When I left my programming career in my early twenties I believed it was because I didn’t like the job. I have since come to learn that this was not the case at all. I 	enjoy programming and am good at it, having dabbled in a variety of different personal projects over the years (although nothing 	particularly significant). I believe I can enjoy and make a successful career in the industry.

So onto my specific questions.  

**As someone in my position, what would be considered the best routes back into the industry?** 

I am in a fortunate position to be able to dedicate myself full-time to whatever route I choose, and am keen to get moving as quickly as possible. I’ve read that coding bootcamps such as those listed here ([https://www.switchup.org/rankings/best-bootcamps-london](https://www.switchup.org/rankings/best-bootcamps-london)) are an excellent approach, but if I’m going to spend the amount of money a lot of those cost, I would like some guidance as to whether they would do what I need. I’m also aware of things like [https://open.appacademy.io/](https://open.appacademy.io/) and other less expensive/free alternatives, but am concerned that these might not be as effective at helping me get past issues around my age and career choices/difficulties to date.

**Within computer programming are there any particular specialisms I should consider focusing on to maximise my chances of achieving this? What is generally in demand and achievable from my position?**

I’m particularly interested in choices here that fulfil my desire to work abroad. Web development is obviously one choice here, but are there others I should be considering?

**Is there anything I haven’t considered that I need to?**

I’ve done a fair bit of reading around this already, but have I missed anything important I need to consider at this stage?

I think that’s about all. Thanks in advance.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey all,&lt;/p&gt;

I’m also aware of things like &lt;a href=""https://open.appacademy.io/""&gt;https://open.appacademy.io/&lt;/a&gt; and other less expensive/free alternatives, but am concerned that these might not be as effective at helping me get past issues around my age and career choices/difficulties to date.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Within computer programming are there any particular specialisms I should consider focusing on to maximise my chances of achieving this? What is generally in demand and achievable from my position?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m particularly interested in choices here that fulfil my desire to work abroad. Web development is obviously one choice here, but are there others I should be considering?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is there anything I haven’t considered that I need to?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve done a fair bit of reading around this already, but have I missed anything important I need to consider at this stage?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think that’s about all. Thanks in advance.&lt;/p&gt;

Reading the actual definition of indirection, ""the ability to reference something using a name, reference, or container instead of the value itself.""

&amp;#x200B;

So from my understanding indirection would be something like this.

&amp;#x200B;

non-indirection:

`console.log(\` 1 + 1 is ${1+1}\`)`

&amp;#x200B;

indirection:

`a = 1 + 1`

`console.log(\`1 + 1 is ${a}\`)`

&amp;#x200B;

An example of multiple levels of indirection would be

&amp;#x200B;

level 1 indirection:

`username = ""foo""`

`password = ""bar""`

[`db.save`](https://db.save)`(username, password)`

&amp;#x200B;

level 2 indirection:

`saveData(username, password){`

[`db.save`](https://db.save)`(username, password)`

`}`

`u = ""foo""`

`p = ""bar""`

`saveData(u, p)`

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Is this correct understanding of indirection? If so what makes this so important in software engineering? Is it because it increases levels of abstraction and therefore makes the overall system easier to understand? How does introducing another level of indirection help solve problems in software engineering?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I came across the &amp;quot;Fundamental theorem of software engineering&amp;quot; while reading a textbook, whose quote is this, &amp;quot;We can solve any problem by introducing an extra level of &lt;a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indirection""&gt;indirection&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

I've looked up tutorials online, but most of them have so far been ""how to create a twitter bot in under 2 mins!!!!!!!!!!!"". Where it directs me to a website to input my twitter information and then input keywords and commands of what to do with those keywords. That's not really what I want. I'm trying to find a detailed guide as to how a twitter bot works and how to set one up from scratch. 

&amp;nbsp;

So far I've managed to use tweepy to manually post on twitter and manually @ people. What I mean by manually, is that I am typing the commands into the python app and entering it every time I want to post something to twitter through my the bot. If I want to post a reply, I'm manually entering their username.

&amp;nbsp; 

So I'm looking for a guide that'll answer the question of how to get a twitter bot to run by itself 24/7 and how can I make that twitter bot interact with twitter by itself? (Such as automatically rt certain keywords, post at certain times, or posts from certain accounts up to this many times per hour.) Do I have to host the twitter bot on a server? If so how do I do that? Is it possible to have a twitter bot running continuously on my own computer or something like a raspberry pi?

&amp;nbsp;

If anyone could provide some guidance or refer me to a guide, that would be greatly appreciated.

 I want to be able to compare more than 2 schools, and I want to be able to have a more specific way of assigning balance. As it stands right now, I assign the user the school of balance if their score is equal throughout the entire questionnaire. However, I think this could be done better as I think it would make more sense if I took an average if the user didn't have an outstanding score that was associated with a specific school. As I introduce my third (technically fourth if we are counting balance) and subsequent schools, I want to be to assign them to balance if all other school values equal the same, but I also feel like there should be a function that takes an average of their score. I am essentially trying to understand and implement my own version of the original quiz which can be found [here](https://wizard101.com). I think my understanding of the algorithm looks something like this:

1. if {school value} is greater than all other schools, assign user to that school
2. else, assign balance, as logically they would only be able to have a perfectly balanced score otherwise
3. if the user matches perfectly to one school (they score the maximum amount of points which would be the number of questions in the quiz, so in this version they would get a perfect match for fire if they chose dragon and tropical island as it would increase their fire score to 2) then print out perfect match, and include an additional statement that tells the user they are destined to be that school.
4. if the user doesn't match any school, and they don't have a perfectly balanced score, add up their score and divide by the number of questions to get an average score and assign whatever score that is to the user score

It's also worth noting that my code isn't by any means 100% consistent and it is obviously only less than an hour into development and this is just for fun so I don't have any concrete parameters to meet. Here is my code:

    }","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;h1&gt;I have a couple of questions as I go on to continue expanding this project.&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to be able to compare more than 2 schools, and I want to be able to have a more specific way of assigning balance. As it stands right now, I assign the user the school of balance if their score is equal throughout the entire questionnaire. However, I think this could be done better as I think it would make more sense if I took an average if the user didn&amp;#39;t have an outstanding score that was associated with a specific school. As I introduce my third (technically fourth if we are counting balance) and subsequent schools, I want to be to assign them to balance if all other school values equal the same, but I also feel like there should be a function that takes an average of their score. I am essentially trying to understand and implement my own version of the original quiz which can be found &lt;a href=""https://wizard101.com""&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. I think my understanding of the algorithm looks something like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if {school value} is greater than all other schools, assign user to that school&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;else, assign balance, as logically they would only be able to have a perfectly balanced score otherwise&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if the user matches perfectly to one school (they score the maximum amount of points which would be the number of questions in the quiz, so in this version they would get a perfect match for fire if they chose dragon and tropical island as it would increase their fire score to 2) then print out perfect match, and include an additional statement that tells the user they are destined to be that school.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if the user doesn&amp;#39;t match any school, and they don&amp;#39;t have a perfectly balanced score, add up their score and divide by the number of questions to get an average score and assign whatever score that is to the user score&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s also worth noting that my code isn&amp;#39;t by any means 100% consistent and it is obviously only less than an hour into development and this is just for fun so I don&amp;#39;t have any concrete parameters to meet. Here is my code:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;#include &amp;lt;iostream&amp;gt;

if someone could help figure why it doesn't work or a better way to navigate the file i would be happy","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I want this function to read from a csv file, line by line, and save the contents on the computer memory so later i can acess the data faster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i tried reading directly from the file, but it was too slow because the file is large ( more than 13 milion lines), and if i want to get the data on line 12milion i need to iterate line by line, and that takes a lot time, that&amp;#39;s why i choose to load it on memory.&lt;/p&gt;

[Full Instructions in PDF here](https://docdro.id/SDoD53P)

*Stack name (number of elements);*

 Creates a stack of strings with name “name.”  Internally, each unit of memory allocation is “number of elements” elements.  Users should be smart enough to choose a number of elements that matches their expected usage patterns.""

*Stack class members*

- array size (specified by user when instantiating) 

- linked list definition 

- topElement (element number of the current top element of the stack) 

The element number is logically a “pointer” to the top element.  It always points to the place in the current array where the next element would go.  Again, assume that the array size is 10.  If the element number is 5, then a new element goes into array [5].  When the list is empty, the  element number is zero.  When the element number is 10, the array is full. ""

*Constructor*

- allocate an array of the specified size 

- create a linked list entry containing a pointer to the array 

- set topElement to 0, indicating that the top of the stack is element 0 of the current array""

**What I have so far (I could be totally off):**

We made a linked list in another assignment except we the data was not an array. Idk if i should integrate my entire linked list and all of it's functions or just use the STL list.

//.hpp file

struct LLnode //should i use this or STL list?

{

	string *theData[];

The story is different each time based on random variables and I need the text to change depending on what they are.

For example, I may want to describe a house in the story. It has a few different variables, such as how old it is, whether it has any damage, how valuable it is and the average price of other houses in the same town.

I can create a template that presents this information and then slot in the variables e.g. ""The house is 15 years old. It has a broken window. It's one of the most expensive houses in the town."" This is okay, but comes across as kind of robotic. The way a person would more naturally describe the house is to lead with the most unusual information. If the building has half it's roof falling in, you wouldn't begin by telling someone it's age and price point and then mention that it's absolutely falling apart. You would start by saying that it's a shit hole, even though it's only 5 years old and clearly cost a lot of money to build.

The problem I have is that even with just three variables, once you've identified the most unique feature using the other variables to contextualise that information becomes quite intensive. If I wanted to include more variables such as the owner of the building, the type of architecture and the building's function (i.e. a shop or hotel) it becomes incredibly complex knowing which bits of information to prioritise and how they all relate to each other.

I have no idea how to find approaches to this. When I Google around the idea of generating text all of the results seem to refer to Natural Language Processing and machine learning stuff, which is quite far beyond my understanding.

You would start by saying that it&amp;#39;s a shit hole, even though it&amp;#39;s only 5 years old and clearly cost a lot of money to build.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem I have is that even with just three variables, once you&amp;#39;ve identified the most unique feature using the other variables to contextualise that information becomes quite intensive. If I wanted to include more variables such as the owner of the building, the type of architecture and the building&amp;#39;s function (i.e. a shop or hotel) it becomes incredibly complex knowing which bits of information to prioritise and how they all relate to each other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have no idea how to find approaches to this. When I Google around the idea of generating text all of the results seem to refer to Natural Language Processing and machine learning stuff, which is quite far beyond my understanding. I can&amp;#39;t help but feel there must be a simpler, less sophisticated method that I&amp;#39;m just not aware of.&lt;/p&gt;

I am brushing up on some of my skills and I am having particular trouble understanding how to calculate the time complexity (Big O) of a given solution.

The problem statement is:

Implement a function, findProduct(lst), which modifies a list so that each index has a product of all the numbers present in the list except the number stored at that index.

## Input:

A list of numbers (can even be floats, integers, and negative!)

## Output:

A list such that each index has a product of all the numbers in the list except the number stored at that index.

## Sample Input

    arr = [1,2,3,4]

## Sample Output

    arr = [24,12,8,6]

To which I have produced the following solution:

    from operator import mul
    from functools import reduce
    
    def findProduct(arr): 
        result = []. # 1 
        for entry in arr:  # n
            products = set(arr) # 1 
            products.remove(entry) # 1 
            result.append(reduce(mul, products)) # n-1 or n?
    
        return result # 1

I'm having particular trouble understanding the time complexity and how to calculate it? I have added the time I suspect the time it takes for each step to execute but I am the most unsure on the complexity of the `reduce`

Any help will be greatly appreciated on this on how I can calculate or optimise this solution.Thanks everyone!","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi everyone,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To which I have produced the following solution:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;from operator import mul
from functools import reduce

def findProduct(arr): 
    result = []. # 1 
    for entry in arr:  # n
        products = set(arr) # 1 
        products.remove(entry) # 1 
        result.append(reduce(mul, products)) # n-1 or n?

    return result # 1
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m having particular trouble understanding the time complexity and how to calculate it? I have added the time I suspect the time it takes for each step to execute but I am the most unsure on the complexity of the &lt;code&gt;reduce&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any help will be greatly appreciated on this on how I can calculate or optimise this solution.Thanks everyone!&lt;/p&gt;

Now, I have had a programming course but we didn't do much OOP.  I was stuck on a problem and eventually figured out a crude solution to it. The problem is [2.3 (2D vectors)](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-01sc-introduction-to-electrical-engineering-and-computer-science-i-spring-2011/unit-1-software-engineering/object-oriented-programming/MIT6_01SCS11_designLab01.pdf). 

Let me restate the problem here:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; Define a Python class V2, which represents two-dimensional vectors and supports the following operations:  
&gt;  
&gt; • Create a new vector out of two real numbers: v = V2(1.1, 2.2)   
&gt;  
&gt;• Convert a vector to a string (with the \_\_str\_\_ method)   
&gt;  
&gt;• Access the components (with the getX and getY methods)   
&gt;  
&gt;• Add two V2s to get a new V2 (with add and \_\_add\_\_ methods)   
&gt;  
&gt;• Multiply a V2 by a scalar (real or int) and return a new V2 (with the mul and \_\_mul\_\_ methods) 

&amp;#x200B;

Now my solution to the problem is given below:

    class V2: 
        def __init__(self,X,Y):
           self.m=[X,Y]
        def __str__(self):
            return 'V2'+str(self.m)
        def getX(self):
            return self.m[0]
        def getY(self):
            return self.m[1]
        def add(self,n):
            return [self.m[0]+n.getX(),n.getY()+self.m[1]]

&amp;#x200B;

So my doubt was regarding the adding part. My return statement seems a bit crude. Is there any elegant way of doing it?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Currently, I am doing the MIT OCW&amp;#39;s &lt;a href=""https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-01sc-introduction-to-electrical-engineering-and-computer-science-i-spring-2011/index.htm""&gt;6.01&lt;/a&gt; Intro to EECS I.

First time here,

I'm currently an English teacher, but I'm considering learning to code and trying to make a living from that. This came partly from a weekend spent with GameMaker that ended up being a year-long project.

My question is this - What's the best way to learn? I have considered taking a programming course, but the options are so varied online that it's hard to discern what the most viable option would be - both in terms of my current skill level and attractiveness to employers. I'm told that C#, Python and Swift are good options to learn, but I'm wary of wasting my time  learning something pointless.

As far as employment, my current situation is one in which I'd like to be able to start making money fairly quickly. Has anyone managed to make a reasonable living working online/freelancing, or would full-time employment be the way to go?

I've run into some trouble with what I think is a pretty basic issue.

When a user uses my program, one of the first things they do is to register with some basic information, such as name, email, address etc. This is all done on a pretty simple GUI. I use some event handlers to save this information locally to a variable, so for example I have a String variable for Name, I use the event handler to get the name and set the variable Name value to that entry. Once the form is complete and I have all the information I need, I create a User object. My user class looks like this:

    Class User{
   
    String Name:
    String Address;
    int phoneNumber;
 
    public User(String Name, String Address, int phoneNumber){
    this.Name = Name;
    this.Address = Address;
    this.phoneNumber = phoneNumber;
    }

}

Pretty basic as you can see. Now, I have a User object with the information provided and want to save this to my SQL database. Here is where my confusion lies. My initial solution was to simply create a table with Users in it and the three different values and save this. However, this does not save the object itself, but rather the values and I want the object to be saved so that I can perform operations on it later. 

My question is, do I save the object to the database and if so, how? If this isn't correct and I should save the values, does this mean each time I retrieve the values I have to recreate the object? I think the first solution - saving the object and not the values - is correct, please let me know if I am wrong.

I use some event handlers to save this information locally to a variable, so for example I have a String variable for Name, I use the event handler to get the name and set the variable Name value to that entry. Once the form is complete and I have all the information I need, I create a User object. My user class looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Class User{

String Name:
String Address;
int phoneNumber;

public User(String Name, String Address, int phoneNumber){
this.Name = Name;
this.Address = Address;
this.phoneNumber = phoneNumber;
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pretty basic as you can see. Now, I have a User object with the information provided and want to save this to my SQL database. Here is where my confusion lies. My initial solution was to simply create a table with Users in it and the three different values and save this. However, this does not save the object itself, but rather the values and I want the object to be saved so that I can perform operations on it later. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My question is, do I save the object to the database and if so, how? If this isn&amp;#39;t correct and I should save the values, does this mean each time I retrieve the values I have to recreate the object? I think the first solution - saving the object and not the values - is correct, please let me know if I am wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks.&lt;/p&gt;

My impression of a function is that you code one if you have repeating code blocks that perform specific tasks, like adding values or parsing strings.

The thing I am coding doesn't necessarily have repeating code, however, it does have ""steps"", or code blocks that perform specific tasks. The way I have my code structured is that I parsed my code into those code blocks that do specific, non-repetitive tasks, and moved them into functions. For example:

Void step1;

Void step2;

Void step3;

int main() {

  step1;

  Step2;

  Step3;

}

Additionally, I have it so that if something gives an error in one of the functions, I exit in the function, as opposed to returning to main. The reasoning behind it is that it would use more lines up to return a value to main indicating an error, then exiting in main. However, I was told in school that we should always try to exit in main.

Is that good or bad coding practice?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I suppose that this question could be for any language, but I&amp;#39;m coding in C right now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My impression of a function is that you code one if you have repeating code blocks that perform specific tasks, like adding values or parsing strings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The thing I am coding doesn&amp;#39;t necessarily have repeating code, however, it does have &amp;quot;steps&amp;quot;, or code blocks that perform specific tasks. The way I have my code structured is that I parsed my code into those code blocks that do specific, non-repetitive tasks, and moved them into functions. For example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Void step1;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Void step2;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Void step3;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;int main() {&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;step1;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Step2;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Step3;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, I have it so that if something gives an error in one of the functions, I exit in the function, as opposed to returning to main. The reasoning behind it is that it would use more lines up to return a value to main indicating an error, then exiting in main. However, I was told in school that we should always try to exit in main.&lt;/p&gt;

Definitions for peoples who are graduated and don’t have to remember all the technical terms:

Strongly Connected Digraph: A directional graph that given any node u as a starting point, some path exists to any node v as an ending point for all nodes in the graph. 

Source: A node that has edges exiting the node and entering other nodes, but has no edges entering the node. 

Sink: A node that has edges entering the node from some exterior node, but has no edges exiting the node.


Problem Statement:

Given some list of edges in a digraph G, where each edge can be represented as (u, v) such that there is a directed edge from node u to node v, generate a minimal list of edges that when added to G cause it to be strongly connected. 

Now, I know that determining the number of edges required isn’t difficult at all. If you count the sources and the sinks in the graph, that the minimum number of edges needed to make the graph strongly connected is MAX(num_sources, num_sinks). 

The issue I am having is with figuring out which edges to add to the graph. 

Initially, I thought “oh this will be easy” and I proceeded to gather up all the Sink nodes in a set P, and gather up all the source nodes in a set S. Then I would iterate through the sinks, and start connecting them to sources. If I ran out of sources I would just connect the remaining sinks to any node, if I ran out of sinks, I would then pick any random node and connect it to the remaining sources. This worked in some instances. 

The issue I encountered with the above, is that depending on the initial graph, it could lead to having multiple strongly connected components, instead of 1 strongly connected component. Maybe 3 nodes form a triangle, then another 2 nodes connect to eachother, but there was no path from triangle to the other 2 nodes.

The next approach I took, was to write a method that finds all the strongly connected components, using Kosaraju’s algorithm. 
Performing a DFS, transposing the graph, and then performing a DFS by finish order on the transposed graph to find the SCC’s. 

This is helpful in determining if a graph is strongly connected, but it still doesn’t quite solve the problem, because in some inputs every single node is its own component, because there might be 0 cycles in the graph. 

I’ve been searching for white-papers on this, or a proof, or a general algorithm and I haven’t had much luck. 

Currently I have the following:

A get_SS() method that gets the sources and sinks as a source array and a sink array of nodes. 

A get_SCC() method that returns a 2-dimensional array containing the strongly connected components each as a node list. 

And all the related methods, such as a performDFS() method, a transpose_G() method, methods to add edges, etc. (The code isn’t as important, I’m hoping for help with the algorithm side of things)

Currently I’m attempting to find the strongly connected components, sources, sinks, figure out which edge to add (where I am stuck) then repeat, until the graph returns as only 1 strongly connected component. 

Does anyone know of an algorithm/white-paper that discusses this problem, or have any ideas on a good approach to solving it? 

Thanks!

I have a doubly linked list with a private Node struct that has three string variables (firstName, lastName, and value). The program has a linked list of a roster of players. I am trying to create a function that takes three roster class (one, two, and three), where three is a list of each unique player between one and two. I am not allowed to change the public interface given, all the functions of which only return bool and as far I know would not help me access the private variables.

Edit: for clarity, the only thing I am allowed to do is add private functions and variables. I cannot add any public functions or variables, or other classes/structs including using the keyword friend.

Here are the parts where he outlines the project. Maybe you can see an assumption that I am making that is incorrect that would allow me to do this:

Using only the public interface of BballRoster, implement the following two functions. (Notice that they are non-member functions; they are not members of BballRoster or any other class.)bool joinRosters(const BballRoster &amp; bbOne, const BballRoster &amp; bbTwo, BballRoster &amp; bbJoined); When this function returns, bbJoined must consist of pairs determined by these rules: If a full name appears in exactly one of bbOne and bbTwo, then bbJoined must contain an element consisting of that full name and its corresponding value. If a full name appears in both bbOne and bbTwo, with the same corresponding value in both, then bbJoined must contain an element with that full name and value. When this function returns, bbJoined must contain no elements other than those required by these rules. (You must not assume bbJoined is empty when it is passed in to this function; it might not be.) If there exists a full name that appears in both bbOne and bbTwo, but with different corresponding values, then this function returns false; if there is no full name like this, the function returns true. Even if the function returns false, result must be constituted as defined by the above rules. 

Except to add a destructor, copy constructor, assignment operator, and dump function (described below), you must not add functions to, delete functions from, or change the public interface of the BballRoster class. You must not declare any additional struct/class outside the BballRoster class, and you must not declare any public struct/class inside the BballRoster class. You may add whatever private data members and private member functions you like, and you may declare private structs/classes inside the BballRoster class if you like.

&lt;p&gt;And, without it being 3. Even if its in the list.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9]
&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; closest(lst, 3)

I have been learning front-end programming for about a year and have spent most of the last 6 months contributing to a large open source project. Through that process I feel I know what it should feel like to solve a problem.

I am preparing to go through my first junior interviews to get my first software job, and to prepare for the technical portion I have started with [AlgoExpert.io](https://AlgoExpert.io). I like the format because it is inspired by Cracking The Coding Interview but it's a digestible set of problems.

I have no background whatsoever in computer science which may be part of the problem. Whenever I see a new problem, I try to solve it with something other than a brute-force solution but usually can't. The optimal solution seems so obscure to me that I would never have figured it out. The exception to this are the easier questions like nth fibonacci, bubble sort, insertion sort, and selection sort. I didn't figure some of those out on my own but when I review the solution, I intuitively ""get"" it. I don't really have to memorize it as much --- I just visualize how it works and that clicks for me.

Other solutions seem so unintuitive that the best I can do is memorize what seems to me like a trick. Is this normal? Is this just learning? Because I really would prefer to be able to actually figure out the solution without help. I've gotten out of the habit of memorizing stuff because it reminds me of the shallow learning I did in public school, but if that's what needs to be done to start recognizing patterns I'm more than happy to.

I ask a question that I have in my mind for long time: I’m beginner developer (although I have been programming for a long time, I still consider myself a beginner).I have seen many languages ​​during these years (Java, C #, Python, some Javascript, HTML, CSS, a little PHP and the various MVC architectures, APIs , networking and a little SQL and MySQL).But even though I’ve seen all these things, I’d like to create something, even to find a job and prove to myself that I can program (sometimes there are days that discourage me because of my skills because sometimes I consider myself logical 📷).My problem that I saw a lot of sites even for freelancers and I saw that there are so many people who know how to do many things and have many years of experience so I am very discouraged by this as I won’t be able to find a job (I’m currently in an internship, but I don’t like it).I asked for suggestions about it:-What languages ​​should I concentrate on? (I am now adoring Python and I’m also looking at some Javascript and Golang)

* What principles or architectures should I look further? (aka MVC)
* What projects should I consider to include in my developer portfolio?
* What are the steps to becoming a full-stack developer?If there were any suggestions on paths to take before becoming a good programmer are welcome!(Sorry for long post 📷)P.S Sorry also for my bad English, but It’s not my first language ( I’m Italian girl)

What I want to do is to allow for a user defined order in a database without running into size or precision issues when repeatedly inserting between the same two positions.

Suppose we have a row with position `1` and one with position `2`.
If we want to insert between the two, a naive approach would be to just do `new_position = (position_1 + position_2) / 2`. If this is stored as a numerical value it can be used to sort the table easily and generating new position values is trivial. 
However, it will run into precision issue when storing it as a float, and if stored as numeric, it can grow quite large pretty quick. So this isn't and ideal solution.

My solution was to use a stern-brocot tree to find fractions between two positions and store these as a float.
This seems to be a solution that shouldn't run into precision issues and size issues should also not occur easily and it is still easily sortable.

The issue here is performance. I'm doing this in Python, and am running into problems quite soon when repeatedly inserting between the same positions, so I've resolved to normalize the positions once the computation of a new insert takes too long. This is not ideal since it isn't really what I'm after. I could have done the same with floats when running into precision issues.
I've been experimenting with using Rust to generate the tree, which solves the performance problems but I've been thinking that there must be a better way. Even when using Rust at some point, finding a new fraction will take too long.

I currently write python which doesn't have great audio capabilities, so I'm willing to learn a new language to accomplish this. It comes stock with a library for playing .wav files which cannot play multiple at once. You can use a library (I don't remember which one) to write one .wav file on top of the other before playback but this is hacky and doesn't work for all use-cases (for example if I wanted to trigger different files on key input, ie; at arbitrary times). It also requires you to save the new combined sound as a file on the computer temporarily which I don't like as there could potentially be hundreds you need to generate for a given program. And as an alternative to that, some people online recommend multithreading which isn't a good idea if you plan to have more than a couple sounds going at once at any point.

What I'm **potentially** looking for (alternative described below) is a way to reference existing audio files and be able to play them on top of one another, without the problems I outlined above. In pseduocode a successful program would look something like this, where ""library.play"" represents whatever function I write or get from a library to play the chords: 

    A = A.wav

End result should be the files A.wav C.wav E.wav playing on top of one another, then the same for A.wav D.wav F.wav, and so on. The chordList object would of course be determined programmatically, since I could obviously just write those chords into MIDI in a DAW and play them if I knew what they would be to begin with. I can already generate melodies/chords via an algorithm, I just want a way to play them inside of the program when I run it.

Alternatively, I suspect there might already be either a DAW that supports coding like this internally or a library that allows you to send MIDI events to an external synth, sampler, or DAW. That would also be acceptable.

I can't really name names, but I am an audio engineer and working musician who's been given the opportunity to consult and advise a small team on improving a windows based audio enhancement program. The CEO inherited the program and company from his late father, and doesn't understand it very well. There is a front end/UI developer on the team as well, but there really aren't any other employees.

I've been told that I am guaranteed a substantial raise and increase in hours if I am able to personally make the proposed changes to this audio DSP's backend code. This would begin within the next three or four months. This is the greatest job I've ever had, pays above my market rate already, and I am absolutely going to be gunning to take on this role. 

The relevant info about my situation:

- I am just learning code. As in, never written a line before two weeks ago.

- Evidently the DSP is written in C, at least the portions that would be relevant to my responsibilities. 

- This job is incredibly lenient, so there is not a true ""hard"" deadline for me to be able to fulfill this new role. However, I would like to be able to show that I can meet this expectation if possible.

- I have completed two ~4 hour 'Intro To C' courses that have helped me get literate about terminology, and I am now halfway through Harvard's online CS50 lecture series. In my own practice I can now write simple terminal programs up to using if/else/for loops, and am practicing learning arrays, structures, and writing and retrieving simple .txt files. I also am practicing documentation and trying to learn common professional code styling.


My questions for the community:

- Is my goal possible, or is DSP configuration in C a lofty target? Would this be a question of time, or do I need to tell my boss that we should be looking at a more experienced developer?

- With all this time investment, coupled with the fact that the field of audio engineering in my area is completely flooded, is it a wise call to try and learn C, then C++ to pivot into a software programming career? I don't want to invest dozens of hours and then not continue to become good at this, but if these languages aren't worth it I want to make sure my focus is in the right area.

- Am I on a good learning track? I am trying to take as much of the advice I find to heart, and I try to practice on my own and not just parrot tutorials. 

- Do I need a Github account to use Git? And what is the best way to learn Git? I want to use version control for this project, even if it's just me and someone else. I want to practice on a practical level. 

- Other than just the languages and Git, what other relevant practices/programs would be common and good to practice and cite on a resume? If I'm doing this I want to make sure that my skills cover the basics of what's actually expected in the workplace.

- Other than DSP's, is audio knowledge useful in this field? I was the head of audio for a major U.S. airline and a lead audio engineer for several studios and major venues, so I don't want to let all that knowledge not apply to my future if I can help it (or if it will give me a leg up)

- Is the C/C++ field flooded with candidates? Is there a language that pairs well with these to increase hirability? 

I'll stop there, before this gets extreme. I appreciate any time that you people can offer, and hopefully I'll be joining your ranks officially soon!","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello all!&lt;/p&gt;

The calculator portion of the program works, however, the location finder does not. When opening the app, the user sees a simple calculator and below it, a button with a text box that simply says &amp;quot;text view&amp;quot;. When the button is pressed, the user will then be sent to the Location settings. The user will turn the location on. The code should have allowed the user to see the latitude and longitude afterwards, however, it does not. I am using an Amazon Fire Tablet to run this app. When stack tracing, I found this error(?): W/IInputConnectionWrapper: showStatusIcon on inactive InputConnection&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am not sure what that mean. I am fairly new to Java so I am not sure how to approach this problem.&lt;/p&gt;

I'm trying to use the ""i"" and ""j"" values to describe the ""x"" and ""y"" of the pixel I want to modify, but pygame seems to be reading that as a different data type than I want? I'm not entirely sure why pygame doesn't expect a tuple for coordinates (seems like the most logical data type for cartesian coordinates to me).

I'm very new to pygame, so I'm hoping this is a relatively simple mistake with an easy fix. If you want the docs for this specific function: [https://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/surface.html#pygame.Surface.set\_at](https://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/surface.html#pygame.Surface.set_at)

Thanks!","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am coding a basic Python program that reads data from a file where each character represents a pixel&amp;#39;s color and then displays that info on the screen using pygame.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve got a block of code that reads the file which works beautifully, but when I try to display the pixels one by one, I get an error that says &amp;quot;descriptor &amp;#39;set_at&amp;#39; for &amp;#39;pygame.Surface&amp;#39; objects doesn&amp;#39;t apply to &amp;#39;tuple&amp;#39; object&amp;quot;. &amp;quot;Grid&amp;quot; is a 2D array that has the 0 and 1 data from the file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;import sys, pygame

            pygame.Surface.set_at((i, j), &amp;quot;black&amp;quot;) #**Throws the error**
        elif grid[i][j] == 1:

While this is a common problem across all skill levels, I see people who are talented, yet give up a bit too easily. It can be frustrating, but overcoming those frustrations and solving problems are one of the many things that create amazing developers. These tips may be common sense to the seasoned developer, but I hope those beginning can find these helpful :-). Let's get on with the tips.

---


- Learn the basics. Yes, it isn't fun, and you might fall asleep since you're not making something flashy, but learning syntax and how they work are crucial. Learning how to read code will help immensely, even when learning functions you're not aware of yet. You'll start to pick up on the logic behind code, but that comes through practice on learning your languages syntax.

---


- If you're not retaining syntax, *don't stress*. Google, Google, and Google. The only way you are going to retain syntax is through repetition and time.  Everyone does this, even the seasoned devs. There's just too much information in a never-ending book of things to learn on code. It will come over time, but you must keep coding rather than just reading.

---


- Don't worry about how good someone is or how fast they learn code. Everyone learns at different paces, and time spent on code isn't linear. While time matters when mastering something, how you get there is completely dependent on that individual's learning methodology. You will find your best method of learning, but you need to keep coding.

---


- Step away if you're frustrated. Play a game, go for a walk, or so something that isn't coding for an hour or two. If you're frustrated, you'll end up fueling it by stumbling over and over due to it. This is where a lot if people give up, and they often underestimate how leisure can clear your mind if clogged thought processes.

---


- Excercise patience. If you don't, you'll end up giving up before you learn anything. A large part of programming are steps and solving logical problems. Don't get me wrong, in a world that wants things done in an instant, you will want to become an overnight success. Taking time on solving your errors will go a LONG way, so rather than rushing, take your time to understand things. You will often learn more than one thing when debugging one or two errors.

---


- Once you learn the basics, start working on something *you* want to create. This is the biggest step of them all. This is the phase where you will learn the most. When you are working on something you like, you gain motivation. You want to learn more, you want to learn how to make something happen, and over time, endless hours will be spent on code. This leads to ""muscle memory"", and you start to retain syntax, as well as pick up on newer methods and functions faster. You will want to code, and keep trying to solve a problem. Learning exercises are fine, but doing something you personally want to create will ultimately lead to a faster and significantly funner learning experience.

---


I hope this helps anyone that is starting out. Keep at it, and you'll make that app you've been wanting to make. I know it may seem a bit brief, but I hope to spark motivation in those that are hoping to become programmers.

&gt; Another  use of bracket notation on objects is to access a property which is  stored as the value of a variable. This can be very useful for iterating  through an object's properties or when accessing a lookup table.  
&gt;  
&gt;Here is an example of using a variable to access a property:

&gt;`var dogs = {`

&gt;  
&gt;`var someObj = {`

`};`  
`function propPrefix(str) {`

&gt;Note that we do *not* use quotes around the variable name when using it to access the property because we are using the *value* of the variable, not the *name*.

My solution:

Process A
    A1: load m
    A2: multiply m by 2
    A3: store m in n

Process B
    B1: load n
    B2: increment n by 1
    B3: store n in m

&lt;p&gt;Consider if the following statements in process A and B are atomic and transform the program to load/store architecture if necessary. Also identify the conflicting pairs of atomic instructions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;int n = 0, m = 1;&lt;/p&gt;

I set off as many do by searching, at great length, for what language I should learn, and where from, returning to this topic several times over the course of my journey.  I came across several threads suggesting one language or learning platform over another, and thought to share my particular experience in case it's helpful for someone else in the same discernment process.

Disclaimer: I'm not a professional programmer, and although I am using my skills to benefit my work (you can read about my search for a prototype framework [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/dcfih6/ive_attempted_to_make_the_same_2d_game_prototype/)), coding continues to be a hobby for me rather than a source of income, whatever that tells you.

Also disclaimer: I'm not attempting to position one language or learning platform over another, and I quite obviously haven't tried to learn every language out there, on every platform.  The following is just my experience trying to figure out the most sensible way forward in an admittedly confusing environment.

You can also **skip to the bottom for the TL;DR**.

**Prologue: C++**

I'm not quite sure if I already knew that C++ was and continues to be a cornerstone in video game development, or if I saw it in one of those ""What Programming Language Should I Learn"" infographics that are about, but I wanted to know more about how games are made and how to talk to the computer.  I'm pretty tech-friendly and have built or tinkered with my own PCs, thinking that might lend itself to the experience of learning how to code.

Holy smokes was I way out of my depth.  I did a few tutorials online (I think through [learncpp](https://www.learncpp.com/) or similar) and soon realized that I would need more guidance to understand basic object oriented programming principles, in perhaps a more readily accessible language, than I was finding in learning C++.

**HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python: The Codecademy Experience**

Before embarking on this adventure, I already had a little HTML experience, and came across [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com). I very much liked the ability to do tutorials from within the browser and without having to set up an IDE (doing so for C++ had been a trying experience), and quickly consumed all of Codecademy's lessons on HTML and CSS.  The natural path from that point was to do the JavaScript course, which I enjoyed, and I soon found myself in ""tutorial purgatory"" (not my reference), working through the Python course and others.

I should also mention that I completed Codecademy's courses as a free user, not wanting to pay a subscription fee for what they were offering at the time, which included projects and mentor support.

I learned a lot of basics from Codecademy and general OOP principles, but didn't wind up applying much of it without a clear path forward.  I returned to my search (who am I kidding, I've spent a LOT of time concurrently researching other languages, learning platforms, and bootcamps throughout the whole process) and decided I wanted to learn more about game development through courses on Unity.

**C#: The Udemy Experience**

I found [Ben Tristem's Unity course](https://www.udemy.com/course/unitycourse/) on one of Udemy's  perennial 10000% off sales, and worked diligently through the tutorials to build clones of 2D brick breaking and other games, learning just enough C# to get by but not enough to feel confident in making anything myself.

Unity itself was probably more of a roadblock here than Tristrem and co.'s instruction, which was actually quite good.  The Unity editor is a beast of an engine, with a lot of good tools that are impenetrable to a novice user (again, you can read more about my experience with Unity [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/dcfih6/ive_attempted_to_make_the_same_2d_game_prototype/)).

I still feel like I learned a lot from the courses and the simple act of being exposed to C# and Unity's desired work flow, but wasn't getting enough out of the experience to continue.  A friend of mine tipped me to take a look at freeCodeCamp, which is where I went next.

**Back to JavaScript: The freeCodeCamp Experience**

On first blush, [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) has the look of a less flashy Codecademy or [Treehouse](https://teamtreehouse.com), but I liked how straightforward the tutorials were and without feeling like I needed to get past a paywall to make progress.  I picked up where I left off with learning HTML and CSS, making good progress until I got to the Responsive Web Design projects that are required to finish the first section and receive a certification.

I can say with certainty that this was the moment (or series of moments) of my ejection from tutorial purgatory.  For a novice with no real professional web design experience, and a willingness to figure out my own solutions without Googling the answer, the projects were *hard*.  I eventually won out and made a couple of silly sites that satisfied the requirements, but the experience spurred me to work through several more freeCodeCamp tutorials on JavaScript front end libraries and back end frameworks.

More importantly, I started to work on my own web-related projects on [CodePen](https://codepen.io/) and game projects using a bunch of different engines.  I also started using Python to do some basic social analytics in my day job, and found it helpful.

**Post-Tutorial Purgatory: The Documentation &amp; Googling Experience**

Fast forward much time later, and I'm now working on several game-related projects in [Phaser](http://phaser.io/) and Unity (most notably, a [digital prototype](https://sominator.github.io/hacker-battles/) for a [tabletop card game](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/msfarzan/entromancy-hacker-battles) I'm developing).  I've spent a whole heck of a lot of time in framework documentation and Stack Overflow looking for answers and best practices for stuff (linking [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/dcfih6/ive_attempted_to_make_the_same_2d_game_prototype/) one more time for good measure).  I also have developed friendships with a few colleagues who are themselves programmers, and it's been helpful to run code by them for advice and feedback.

One thing that's been helpful about working on my own projects is just the basic experience of setting up a workflow.  Learning to use the command line and Git in concert with setting up NPM and a code editor, for example, was eye opening (particularly coming from CodePen, which just does everything for you).  For better or worse, most tutorials don't expose you to the nit and grit of the tools that you'll need to get your work done, and there's a lot to be learned.

If you're reading this and looking for the ""and I just got my first job as a programmer!"" statement, I'm sorry to disappoint!  That hasn't been my objective (at least thus far), but I do have some basic TL;DR learnings to share that may be helpful for anyone who's also on the search for a programming language or a platform on which to learn it.

**TL;DR**

* **JavaScript:**
   * Pro: A very good entry point into learning object oriented programming, particularly if you're interested in any kind of web development (front or back end).  You can learn this through most platforms, but my experience was best served by freeCodeCamp.
   * Con: Many sites will tell you that it ""just runs in your browser"" so you ""don't have to set up an IDE"" and is thus easier to learn, but this mindset will only take you so far.  If you're going to do any meaningful development with popular JavaScript frameworks (React, Vue, Express, etc.), you'll wind up setting up something IDE-adjacent with a code editor, package manager, dependencies, etc., *without* the kind of support you'd get from, say, setting up .NET or similar.
* **Python:**
   * Pro: Super friendly for newcomers if the curly braces in other languages are intimidating at first, and a good point of entry if you're interest in getting into back end programming or data science.  I had a good initial onboarding experience through Codecademy.
   * Con: Your options are a little limited if you're looking to get into front end or game development.  There are frameworks, for example, that allow you to make games ([PyGame](https://www.pygame.org/), for instance), but if you're specifically looking into game development, you'd be better served elsewhere.
* **C#:**
   * Pro: A very pleasant language that's well-supported by Microsoft and the open source community.  With it, you can do back end development, make desktop apps, create games (mostly with Unity but there are other engines like [Monogame](http://www.monogame.net/) out there). It may be an unpopular opinion, but I'd recommend first learning C# through [Microsoft tutorials](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/tutorials/) or elsewhere and *then* learning Unity to ease some of the cognitive load imposed by the editor's complexity.
   * Con: Not much to speak of here, unless you really *don't* like Microsoft or really *do* want to work on front end web development.  I could speak volumes about how Unity can improve its user experience, for example, but C# itself is great.
* **General Thoughts:**
   * One of my frustrations in my process of asking the question ""what programming language should I learn?"" was what I felt was the insufficient answer of ""well, what do you want to build?""  I encountered this answer a lot, and don't think it's the right way of approaching learning how to program.  A beginner doesn't have enough context to know what they *can* build, let alone the route to get there (unless they're the type of person that *just wants to make games* or *just wants to land a job as a web developer*).
   * A better answer would be to say, ""try a few tutorials on different sites and in different languages, and see if something strikes you as interesting.  If it does, stick with it; if it doesn't, pick one at random and see where it takes you.  The stuff you'll learn will help irrespective of what you actually wind up doing.""
   * Additionally, if you can force yourself to get out of the tutorial ecosystem and just *make anything* outside of the protected environment that's been set up for you, it'll help teach you things you'll need to eventually know, such as setting up an IDE, searching for answers to questions, and sharing your work.

I hope this post is helpful for others out there who are searching for a programming language or a place to learn it.  And I'd love to hear about your experiences, too!","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Context: I&amp;#39;m a tabletop game developer and digital marketer, and, having spent a long time around games and computers, decided I wanted to learn to code about 3 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I set off as many do by searching, at great length, for what language I should learn, and where from, returning to this topic several times over the course of my journey.  I came across several threads suggesting one language or learning platform over another, and thought to share my particular experience in case it&amp;#39;s helpful for someone else in the same discernment process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Disclaimer: I&amp;#39;m not a professional programmer, and although I am using my skills to benefit my work (you can read about my search for a prototype framework &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/dcfih6/ive_attempted_to_make_the_same_2d_game_prototype/""&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;), coding continues to be a hobby for me rather than a source of income, whatever that tells you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also disclaimer: I&amp;#39;m not attempting to position one language or learning platform over another, and I quite obviously haven&amp;#39;t tried to learn every language out there, on every platform.  The following is just my experience trying to figure out the most sensible way forward in an admittedly confusing environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can also &lt;strong&gt;skip to the bottom for the TL;DR&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prologue: C++&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not quite sure if I already knew that C++ was and continues to be a cornerstone in video game development, or if I saw it in one of those &amp;quot;What Programming Language Should I Learn&amp;quot; infographics that are about, but I wanted to know more about how games are made and how to talk to the computer.  I&amp;#39;m pretty tech-friendly and have built or tinkered with my own PCs, thinking that might lend itself to the experience of learning how to code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Holy smokes was I way out of my depth.  I did a few tutorials online (I think through &lt;a href=""https://www.learncpp.com/""&gt;learncpp&lt;/a&gt; or similar) and soon realized that I would need more guidance to understand basic object oriented programming principles, in perhaps a more readily accessible language, than I was finding in learning C++.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python: The Codecademy Experience&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before embarking on this adventure, I already had a little HTML experience, and came across &lt;a href=""https://www.codecademy.com""&gt;Codecademy&lt;/a&gt;. I very much liked the ability to do tutorials from within the browser and without having to set up an IDE (doing so for C++ had been a trying experience), and quickly consumed all of Codecademy&amp;#39;s lessons on HTML and CSS.  The natural path from that point was to do the JavaScript course, which I enjoyed, and I soon found myself in &amp;quot;tutorial purgatory&amp;quot; (not my reference), working through the Python course and others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I should also mention that I completed Codecademy&amp;#39;s courses as a free user, not wanting to pay a subscription fee for what they were offering at the time, which included projects and mentor support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I learned a lot of basics from Codecademy and general OOP principles, but didn&amp;#39;t wind up applying much of it without a clear path forward.  I returned to my search (who am I kidding, I&amp;#39;ve spent a LOT of time concurrently researching other languages, learning platforms, and bootcamps throughout the whole process) and decided I wanted to learn more about game development through courses on Unity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;C#: The Udemy Experience&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I found &lt;a href=""https://www.udemy.com/course/unitycourse/""&gt;Ben Tristem&amp;#39;s Unity course&lt;/a&gt; on one of Udemy&amp;#39;s  perennial 10000% off sales, and worked diligently through the tutorials to build clones of 2D brick breaking and other games, learning just enough C# to get by but not enough to feel confident in making anything myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unity itself was probably more of a roadblock here than Tristrem and co.&amp;#39;s instruction, which was actually quite good.  The Unity editor is a beast of an engine, with a lot of good tools that are impenetrable to a novice user (again, you can read more about my experience with Unity &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/dcfih6/ive_attempted_to_make_the_same_2d_game_prototype/""&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I still feel like I learned a lot from the courses and the simple act of being exposed to C# and Unity&amp;#39;s desired work flow, but wasn&amp;#39;t getting enough out of the experience to continue.  A friend of mine tipped me to take a look at freeCodeCamp, which is where I went next.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Back to JavaScript: The freeCodeCamp Experience&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On first blush, &lt;a href=""https://www.freecodecamp.org/""&gt;freeCodeCamp&lt;/a&gt; has the look of a less flashy Codecademy or &lt;a href=""https://teamtreehouse.com""&gt;Treehouse&lt;/a&gt;, but I liked how straightforward the tutorials were and without feeling like I needed to get past a paywall to make progress.  I picked up where I left off with learning HTML and CSS, making good progress until I got to the Responsive Web Design projects that are required to finish the first section and receive a certification.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can say with certainty that this was the moment (or series of moments) of my ejection from tutorial purgatory.  For a novice with no real professional web design experience, and a willingness to figure out my own solutions without Googling the answer, the projects were &lt;em&gt;hard&lt;/em&gt;.  I eventually won out and made a couple of silly sites that satisfied the requirements, but the experience spurred me to work through several more freeCodeCamp tutorials on JavaScript front end libraries and back end frameworks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More importantly, I started to work on my own web-related projects on &lt;a href=""https://codepen.io/""&gt;CodePen&lt;/a&gt; and game projects using a bunch of different engines.  I also started using Python to do some basic social analytics in my day job, and found it helpful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Post-Tutorial Purgatory: The Documentation &amp;amp; Googling Experience&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fast forward much time later, and I&amp;#39;m now working on several game-related projects in &lt;a href=""http://phaser.io/""&gt;Phaser&lt;/a&gt; and Unity (most notably, a &lt;a href=""https://sominator.github.io/hacker-battles/""&gt;digital prototype&lt;/a&gt; for a &lt;a href=""https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/msfarzan/entromancy-hacker-battles""&gt;tabletop card game&lt;/a&gt; I&amp;#39;m developing).  I&amp;#39;ve spent a whole heck of a lot of time in framework documentation and Stack Overflow looking for answers and best practices for stuff (linking &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/dcfih6/ive_attempted_to_make_the_same_2d_game_prototype/""&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt; one more time for good measure).  I also have developed friendships with a few colleagues who are themselves programmers, and it&amp;#39;s been helpful to run code by them for advice and feedback.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing that&amp;#39;s been helpful about working on my own projects is just the basic experience of setting up a workflow.  Learning to use the command line and Git in concert with setting up NPM and a code editor, for example, was eye opening (particularly coming from CodePen, which just does everything for you).  For better or worse, most tutorials don&amp;#39;t expose you to the nit and grit of the tools that you&amp;#39;ll need to get your work done, and there&amp;#39;s a lot to be learned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;re reading this and looking for the &amp;quot;and I just got my first job as a programmer!&amp;quot; statement, I&amp;#39;m sorry to disappoint!  That hasn&amp;#39;t been my objective (at least thus far), but I do have some basic TL;DR learnings to share that may be helpful for anyone who&amp;#39;s also on the search for a programming language or a platform on which to learn it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TL;DR&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JavaScript:&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pro: A very good entry point into learning object oriented programming, particularly if you&amp;#39;re interested in any kind of web development (front or back end).  You can learn this through most platforms, but my experience was best served by freeCodeCamp.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Con: Many sites will tell you that it &amp;quot;just runs in your browser&amp;quot; so you &amp;quot;don&amp;#39;t have to set up an IDE&amp;quot; and is thus easier to learn, but this mindset will only take you so far.  If you&amp;#39;re going to do any meaningful development with popular JavaScript frameworks (React, Vue, Express, etc.), you&amp;#39;ll wind up setting up something IDE-adjacent with a code editor, package manager, dependencies, etc., &lt;em&gt;without&lt;/em&gt; the kind of support you&amp;#39;d get from, say, setting up .NET or similar.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Python:&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pro: Super friendly for newcomers if the curly braces in other languages are intimidating at first, and a good point of entry if you&amp;#39;re interest in getting into back end programming or data science.  I had a good initial onboarding experience through Codecademy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Con: Your options are a little limited if you&amp;#39;re looking to get into front end or game development.  There are frameworks, for example, that allow you to make games (&lt;a href=""https://www.pygame.org/""&gt;PyGame&lt;/a&gt;, for instance), but if you&amp;#39;re specifically looking into game development, you&amp;#39;d be better served elsewhere.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;C#:&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pro: A very pleasant language that&amp;#39;s well-supported by Microsoft and the open source community.  With it, you can do back end development, make desktop apps, create games (mostly with Unity but there are other engines like &lt;a href=""http://www.monogame.net/""&gt;Monogame&lt;/a&gt; out there). It may be an unpopular opinion, but I&amp;#39;d recommend first learning C# through &lt;a href=""https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/tutorials/""&gt;Microsoft tutorials&lt;/a&gt; or elsewhere and &lt;em&gt;then&lt;/em&gt; learning Unity to ease some of the cognitive load imposed by the editor&amp;#39;s complexity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Con: Not much to speak of here, unless you really &lt;em&gt;don&amp;#39;t&lt;/em&gt; like Microsoft or really &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; want to work on front end web development.  I could speak volumes about how Unity can improve its user experience, for example, but C# itself is great.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

1. It's critical to understand who is your audience. When I wrote my initial slides, I didn't realize I was implicitly teaching computer science majors.

Personally, I use the terminal, write python into plain text files, and run the numbers in the interpreter or open files.

I have a seatmate who codes in Java and he finishes all the activities 5 min after the teacher says the instructions which is insane to me!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m from a marketing background and have no technical abilities in the realms of math and science. I don&amp;#39;t see a lot of success stories here of people who have shifted careers from a course such as marketing or something liberal arts related. Is there anyone out there who can share their story of successfully transitioning from a non technical background to a programming job?&lt;/p&gt;

Sorry if this is a non-problem for many, but it seems to be a problem for me :(I would need some guidance on how to approach the problem I am having, appreciate any input!

**Premise:** With Python and Click, I am building, for fun, a CLI tool that I can use for DM-ing my D&amp;D sessions.

**Question:** How to store the data I want to read-only through my CLI tool?

**Issue:** I am a bit at a loss because I do not know how to decide how to build a db containing the data I want my CLI tool to show me.

**Disclaimer:** I am aware that [some databases containing D&amp;D data](https://github.com/adrpadua/5e-database) have been created, but I would like to create one myself because I would like my database to store the information the way I need - for example, I would like the information returned in my CLI app to include homebrews, monster stat blocks, items i find and like and progressively add them to my data.

**Usage:** Ideally I would love to create a MUD-like Knowledge Base for myself, so that I can type through my CLI, for example, `$ spell [name]` for a quick lookup of what that does or `$ monster [goblin]` to get my monster stat block.

**Note**: I am not asking help on *how* to build the app or how to build the queries, rather some suggestions on how to concretely decide which way is the best way to build a db containing the data I need.

My research kept pointing me towards sqlite3 as the best way to achieve this, but I am dubious and ignorant, so I wonder if there are better ways (relative to what I want to achieve) to go with this.

I'm currently teaching english in Japan and my students are bored out of their minds with the textbooks we are assigned to use. What I'm hoping to do is write a program where I can give it a list of vocabulary words, and then have the program search through many subtitle files (notepad files), and if it finds one of the words then it records which subtitle file it found it in and which word it found. Then I can know which episodes contain content I can use to teach.

I'm hoping to use a show like the simpsons to teach them the grammar and vocabulary they need to learn but in a much funner way that might actually get them interested. If I can make clips with the relevant words or themes that relate to the textbooks we use, I think I can really help my students to improve. The problem is it would be much too time consuming to manually search for the targeted vocabulary words since the textbooks have a lot of words, and there are a lot of episodes of the Simpsons.

I would be hugely appreciative if you can tell me if this is possible to do and what language to use to do it. Once I have a starting point I will attempt to teach myself how to do the task, I just dont know right now where to begin.

    &lt;/xs:schema&gt;","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;How do you assign values to all the elements of an xsd file after generating a class from it. I have a main xsd file and two other files linked to the main. The main xsd file contains&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;xs:import namespace=&amp;quot;urn:cl:schema:common&amp;quot; schemaLocation=&amp;quot;common.xsd&amp;quot;/&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;xs:import namespace=&amp;quot;urn:cl:schema:common_dec&amp;quot; schemaLocation=&amp;quot;common_declaration.xsd&amp;quot;/&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After I created an instance of this class I accessed its elements and assigned values in this way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;  Dim afrdeclaration As AFRDeclaration = New AFRDeclaration
        afrdeclaration.MessageDateTime = 20140916142410
        afrdeclaration.MessageVersion = MessageVersion.Item2
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But  I cannot assign values this way&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;afrdeclaration.Declaration.BillAdditionalDocument.MessageRefNo = &amp;quot;AA001&amp;quot;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can only assign values to the immediate element of &amp;#39;&lt;strong&gt;afrdeclaration&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;#39; but I cannot assign values to &amp;#39;&lt;strong&gt;MessageRefN&lt;/strong&gt;o&amp;#39; which belongs to the &amp;#39;&lt;strong&gt;BilladditionalDocument&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;#39; which belongs to &amp;#39;Declaration&amp;#39; which then belongs to &amp;#39;&lt;strong&gt;AFRDeclaration&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;#39;. I get an error stating &amp;#39;Object reference not set to an instance of an object&amp;#39; error. How do I access the child elements? Since my end goal is to generate an xml file from it. &lt;/p&gt;

**Step 5 — Setting Up a Virtual Environment**


Now that we have Chocolatey, nano, and Python installed, we can go on to create our programming environment with the venv module.

Virtual environments enable you to have an isolated space on your computer for Python projects, ensuring that each of your projects can have its own set of dependencies that won’t disrupt any of your other projects.


Setting up a programming environment provides us with greater control over our Python projects and over how different versions of packages are handled. This is especially important when working with third-party packages.


You can set up as many Python programming environments as you want. Each environment is basically a directory or folder in your computer that has a few scripts in it to make it act as an environment.


Choose which directory you would like to put your Python programming environments in, or create a new directory with mkdir, as in:


mkdir Environments


cd Environments

 I decided to start my journey to learning how to program to make my desk job a bit easier. I work full time as a research specialist, so I go home after work and try to read, watch a lecture, work on a problem, or anything for an hour or two. I just want to do simple things like interact with different excel sheets and databases. I may make my own website one day. I'm only a month or so in, so I haven't really focused on the ultimate goal just trying to learn in general for now. I decided with trying to start with python since I've heard its a beginner friendly language that's widely popular. 

I've been watching videos on youtube to learn. Most recently I started the open course at MIT 6.0001 (I'll post the link below. I know it's been posted on here before though.) I'm 4 lectures in and I'm trying to do the homework (problem set 1). The problem sounds super easy to accomplish but I can't wrap my head around it. Same with some ""finger exercises"" from the textbook they recommend. (I found a free pdf of it pretty easily)

Once I read codes that other people posted to github or overflow, I can understand how they made their code and why it does what it does. Coming up with it on my own just seems so difficult. I could easily look up the answer and probably understand it, but I want to be able to do it myself.

Sorry I kind of rambled with the set up, my question though is how do you get in the head space of a programmer? I can figure out the problem in my head without a program, but translating that into something the computer actually does correctly is a different story. Do you have any advice for someone trying to wrap their head around the basics. For loops and while loops are specifically what are giving me trouble right now, but I was hoping just for some basic advice.

&lt;p&gt;I decided to start my journey to learning how to program to make my desk job a bit easier. I work full time as a research specialist, so I go home after work and try to read, watch a lecture, work on a problem, or anything for an hour or two. I just want to do simple things like interact with different excel sheets and databases. I may make my own website one day. I&amp;#39;m only a month or so in, so I haven&amp;#39;t really focused on the ultimate goal just trying to learn in general for now. I decided with trying to start with python since I&amp;#39;ve heard its a beginner friendly language that&amp;#39;s widely popular. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been watching videos on youtube to learn. Most recently I started the open course at MIT 6.0001 (I&amp;#39;ll post the link below. I know it&amp;#39;s been posted on here before though.) I&amp;#39;m 4 lectures in and I&amp;#39;m trying to do the homework (problem set 1).

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

Maybe I'm just doing this all wrong, I'm just doing things the best way I know how. I'm fresh out of college so I don't have a ton of experience with other codebases. 

I've been given an incredibly deprecated website (I think it was made in 2012) that uses a deprecated database (Mongo, not MongoDB) in mostly PHP. 

The website is comprised of or has files/directories related to PHP, Javascript, jQuery, Wordpress, Bootstrap, Angular, jGrowl(?) and possibly more.

I've been able to get the front-facing website set up but I'm having an incredibly difficult time trying to get to the control panel. I originally thought it was using Wordpress to login, but I then found [files related to Gebo Admin Panel](http://gebo-admin-3.tzdthemes.com/) which then led me to downloading [metisMenu](https://github.com/onokumus/metismenu). I downloaded as many dependencies as I could from the package.json that I have, but a lot of the files are too old: ""Not compatible with your operating system or architecture"" is the error I get from many of the dependencies. The dependencies are pretty much all devDependencies, so I guess they're technically optional? But because I'm trying to get a dev-environment setup, I figured it'd be best to download them.

At the moment, when I go to the control panel link, it brings up the control panel's directory (similar to the Gebo Admin's example page, on the left with Account Manager and whatnot) but all the links are dead and then turns into a white screen. The only errors I seemingly have are 404s related to the login (userInfo and dashboard). This made me think it was just simple missing files, but when I asked my senior dev if they exist on the production website, they don't. So, I think that the website makes the files during the login process. 

My senior dev is the only other dev in our very small team and he's working on restructuring the whole website and database in C#.NET. Alongside that, he's told me directly that I've gotten farther than he has in setting the whole thing up locally. Obviously, my best bet is to ask him for help still, but I'm at my wits end. I'm so frustrated and confused, there's so many things that I don't know what they do or how they're supposed to fit.

Solution was to use `num2 = Array.from(num1);` when assigning num2.

\*\*\* Original Post \*\*\*

I feel like I'm missing something obvious.  I'm working on leetcode's palindrome problem (#9) and don't understand why the num1 variable winds up reversing after I reverse num2.

Why would reversing num2 go back and reverse num1 like that?

    /**
        * @param {number} x
        * @return {boolean}

    var isPalindrome = function(x) {
        let num1 = x.toString().split(''), num2, result;
        num2 = num1;
        console.log(num1);
        num2.reverse();
        console.log(num1, ""what?"");
        console.log(num2);
    };

Here is what I see in stdout:

    [ '1', '2', '1' ]
    [ '1', '2', '1' ] 'what?'
    [ '1', '2', '1' ]
    [ '-', '8', '4' ]
    [ '4', '8', '-' ] 'what?'
    [ '4', '8', '-' ]
    [ '7', '5', '0' ]
    [ '0', '5', '7' ] 'what?'
    [ '0', '5', '7' ]

&amp;#x200B;

I'm building a website with ""fake"" scrolling where I have made 5 sections of the home page, I disabled overflow to prevent users from scrolling and what I inturn have done is used JS eventlistener (wheel) to listen for a scroll and when it does detect a scroll, it adds a class to the specific HTML elements I need which has a css animation attached to it to translate the new section over the previous one.

&amp;#x200B;

The issue I've run into is that if I wheel down one, it's fine, if I pull the wheel back hard, it will rush through the entire eventlistener.

I hope I'm explaining this clearly.

I want to create a visual simulation game as if you were the controller on this line so you can see the physical location of each train and can also control traffic signals/re-route tracks to help guide these trains.

Suppose I store an eastbound route on the line as an array of many latitude, longitude coordinates. Would this be sufficient for adding features later, such as stopping at stations and traffic signals?

How can I store the ""stopping point"" for each station along this route? Similarly, what is the best way to add support for traffic signals along the route? What about implementing speed limits along certain sections of the route? Later in the project, I would also want to implement collision detection for two trains on the same line.

What kind of data structure would be best for this project and how would this be implemented? If I choose to store each latitude, longitude point along the route as a JSON object, what other properties would I need for each point in order to implement the above features?

I am in the works currently of creating a program that takes your roman numeral ex ""CDXCIX"" and outputs the roman number and the decimal value.

Heres my code so far:

    # Input romanNumber = input()
     # Processing romanValues = {'I':1, 'V':5, 'X':10, 'L':50, 'C':100, 'D':500,

I am really stuck on trying to figure out whether I have to use loops, or if I can use if statements to solve it, and then I will start figuring out what to do. I guess essentially what I am saying is I don't exactly know how to ""get started"" on it. The subtractive part of Roman Numerals is really confusing me on what code I will have to write.

I'd be especially happy to read your reply if you are just learning and are pondering the language issue, or have pondered it not long ago.

I think that the source might be that you have no idea about what programming is about(kinda obvious), but:
 - You've read some humour about different languages
 - You rarely hear of some abstract software developers, but you hear about Java/Python/C++/C# developers
 - Your programming friends like some languages, dislike some others, and exchange those opinions with passion
 - Universities have subjects about particular languages
So you have no idea what's it all about, but that language stuff seems important. I think that was my case, but it's honestly hard to remember.

My brother asked me to make a user interface for a very complex excel workbook he put together. His workbook does a ton of math and uses a huge amount of 'if' statements within the cells, but he wants something that hides all of his work from the user so that they only see their input (mostly numbers and drop-down options) and the corresponding output (mostly numbers). Essentially, users will select a few options and put in some numbers to create a sort of 'configuration' that they can print out.

He (my bro) wants to be able to change the formulas, 'if' statements, add inputs and outputs, etc. . He wants that kind of functionality only available to 'admin' type users. So the app needs to have users, passwords, login, permission level and such. Users will also need to be able to save their 'configurations' as drafts, or finalize them, or submit them for review.

I learned Visual Basic through Excel in high school (2004) and I have been using it pretty regularly since, so I've become pretty proficient at making it do what I want, but I think his project warrants some functionality that VBA wasn't really made for (or maybe I just want an excuse to learn another, more practical language(s)).

&amp;#x200B;

From what I've read, SQl, HTML, CSS, PHP, and JS are where I should be focusing.

in SQl, I'll have a table of different configurations, indexed by the user who made them, which stores the user inputs, calculated outputs, passwords, etc. .

another table will store the formulas, indexed by their output-variable-name and the admin who last edited/added them.

in HTML/CSS I'll create the UI; user login page, admin login page, configuration page (new or edit), formula page (new or edit).

So, will I be using JS and/or PHP to do the math and actually make it function? I've tooled around with JS before and I think it will be handling doing all the math; pulling the inputs, matching them to the correct formulas, going through some 'if's', and so on.

Thanks Strangers!","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;So! My brother asked me to make a user interface for a very complex excel workbook he put together. His workbook does a ton of math and uses a huge amount of &amp;#39;if&amp;#39; statements within the cells, but he wants something that hides all of his work from the user so that they only see their input (mostly numbers and drop-down options) and the corresponding output (mostly numbers). Essentially, users will select a few options and put in some numbers to create a sort of &amp;#39;configuration&amp;#39; that they can print out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He (my bro) wants to be able to change the formulas, &amp;#39;if&amp;#39; statements, add inputs and outputs, etc. . He wants that kind of functionality only available to &amp;#39;admin&amp;#39; type users. So the app needs to have users, passwords, login, permission level and such. Users will also need to be able to save their &amp;#39;configurations&amp;#39; as drafts, or finalize them, or submit them for review.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I learned Visual Basic through Excel in high school (2004) and I have been using it pretty regularly since, so I&amp;#39;ve become pretty proficient at making it do what I want, but I think his project warrants some functionality that VBA wasn&amp;#39;t really made for (or maybe I just want an excuse to learn another, more practical language(s)).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From what I&amp;#39;ve read, SQl, HTML, CSS, PHP, and JS are where I should be focusing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;in SQl, I&amp;#39;ll have a table of different configurations, indexed by the user who made them, which stores the user inputs, calculated outputs, passwords, etc. .&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;another table will store the formulas, indexed by their output-variable-name and the admin who last edited/added them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;in HTML/CSS I&amp;#39;ll create the UI; user login page, admin login page, configuration page (new or edit), formula page (new or edit).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, will I be using JS and/or PHP to do the math and actually make it function? I&amp;#39;ve tooled around with JS before and I think it will be handling doing all the math; pulling the inputs, matching them to the correct formulas, going through some &amp;#39;if&amp;#39;s&amp;#39;, and so on. I guess PHP is for taking care of server interactions, like with SQl? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This is where I&amp;#39;m stuck.; I don&amp;#39;t fully understand the job of each language, so I&amp;#39;m looking for some guidance with that.&lt;/strong&gt; Does anyone have a good video I could watch or an article I could read that might help me understand all the things?!  &lt;/p&gt;

/// *How do you find motivation? Especially if you already have a good salary, you already are good enough in your field, etc.*

/// *How are you choosing what to improve/ what to learn? Do you evaluate and prioritise the topics in any way*

Like in C all I/O functions use libraries now I can wrap my head around how you would implement something like Vecors or more dynamics arrays using only standard functionality( In theory not that I good do it well or at all) but Comunicating with hardware parts seems off-limits. 

So how is it done ? Do you have to use assembler to build them ? But wouldn't that mean that you have to remake libraries for each new chipset on the market.

I was trying to implement an algorithm for generating set permutations.  I have got to be honest, I have never really liked recursion. Simpler examples like Fibonacci, mergesort, tree and graph traversals don't really seem that intimidating, but methods like backtracking (not sure if this one can be called backtracking) and this particular approach make my head burn.    
As you can see, I have a lot of print-function throughout the code so that I can understand what is going on better, but anyway it's not even easy to follow the order of execution in this case. Even though I understand the general idea, I find it difficult to explain it line by line.   


Probably, the code here is (which I wrote myself actually, but I just can't convince myself that it works as expected, and why) not difficult for understanding at all, and I am just stupid, but anyway I would appreciate it very much if someone could, well, give some advice on how to learn to visualize recursive solutions more quickly.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;class GeneratePermutations:

The context is that she had an object A, new requirements and she made objects B and C extend A, but even newer requirements wanted something that extends both B and C and talked about how multiple inheritance is not a solution, inheritance is about particularisation not code reuse.

Then she offered a solution with injecting behaviour. Now I do not recognize nor understand the syntax of the language in which this is presented, but I think I understand what is happing. Basically I'm asking for confirmation.

Class House has two fields that are being injected. These fields are something like interfaces, you know what methods they have, but not necessarily what they do (not their concrete type). Then when you want a Default house, an Echo house or a Random house, you just inject data and order (again, interface, order has the method order that accepts data, and each type of ordering does it's own thing).

So instead of having a class for each action, you have a class that accepts actions.

What I don't understand is what exactly is gained by injecting these. If it has no order, it doesn't work, it's a necessary param by all means. How would injection help or be desired here?

Or is the implication that it has a default data and order, and you can inject variants. How is this usually achieved in programming, I'm guessing it's not a language feature. To be more precise, I'm asking ""Do you implement a default and then &lt;&lt;listen&gt;&gt; for injected params??""","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;The video is &amp;quot;Nothing is Something&amp;quot; by Sandi Metz, watching the whole video is by no means what I&amp;#39;m asking, just this slide &lt;del&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMPfEXIlTVE""&gt;not here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/del&gt; &lt;a href=""https://youtu.be/OMPfEXIlTVE?t=1804""&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; - or rather this minute.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The context is that she had an object A, new requirements and she made objects B and C extend A, but even newer requirements wanted something that extends both B and C and talked about how multiple inheritance is not a solution, inheritance is about particularisation not code reuse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then she offered a solution with injecting behaviour. Now I do not recognize nor understand the syntax of the language in which this is presented, but I think I understand what is happing. Basically I&amp;#39;m asking for confirmation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Class House has two fields that are being injected. These fields are something like interfaces, you know what methods they have, but not necessarily what they do (not their concrete type). Then when you want a Default house, an Echo house or a Random house, you just inject data and order (again, interface, order has the method order that accepts data, and each type of ordering does it&amp;#39;s own thing).&lt;/p&gt;

Do you recommend any resources or frameworks to help with learning to do this well?**

Full version:

I've been learning to program for around three months, starting with a focus on Python. I feel like I'm making good progress, and I'm starting to choose the direction I want to specialize in further. It's very exciting!

At the same time, as I've worked on more complicated problems and larger independent projects, I've realized that my overall ""process"" (if you can call it that) could really use some work, so I want to work on learning these meta-skills.

For the most part, it seems to go like this:

1. Get inspired to work on something.
2. Come up with a basic idea for how the program should work in my head.
3. Immediately start translating this idea into code.
4. Run into some problems I hadn't foreseen with how things are structured.
5. Go back and revise my code until I can overcome the immediately obstacle.
6. Continue working on my code until I run into a new problem.
7. (Potentially get distracted from my end goal and end up building / optimizing / creating a scalable version of something that doesn't really matter.)
8. Repeat steps 4-7.

Now, none of this is so terrible at the moment, since I'm mostly focused on learning, and all of this work is definitely good practice.

At the same time, I can see how it's probably not a very good overall approach. Having to go back and significantly alter the program because of unforeseen issues takes a lot of time and energy. It also seems like it's pretty easy to get so wrapped up in what I'm doing that I allow a lot of ""scope creep,"" which has led to some projects seemingly never ending.

Obviously this is partially a pitfall of working alone and my own working style. Still, I feel like there must be a more structured approach than ""just dive in and go for it without any planning or organization"" that more experienced programmers follow. 

I've tried various ways of writing down my plans for the program in advance. I've generally found that this either ends up being way too high level (so not very helpful) or way too detailed (so that it's difficult to easily reference and quickly becomes out of date as things change — and keeping it up to date feels like literally writing the program twice in parallel).

So: how do you approach planning, following the plan, avoiding scope creep, and related issues while programming? And do you have any suggestions for good resources or frameworks that can help me learn to do this?

I tried asking a [similar question](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/d7ssyx/how_to_organize_your_work_on_larger_projects/) in another subreddit a couple of weeks ago, but didn't explain it clearly enough and didn't really get any helpful answers.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TL;DR: How do you plan before actually starting to write code, make yourself follow the plan (despite unforeseeable changes you need to make), and avoid scope creep and distractions?

We get daily summary emails into an inbox for all of our clients, but they come from the same email address so when we export them, the customers are all listed as the same email. The subject includes the customer name, so I need to copy ONLY the customer name from a cell in column 'M' in Excel, into a cell in column 'B'. This needs to happen for every single row in the worksheet, but I'm a little stuck on the code side. Please could I have some assistance?

For reference, the email subject we receive is: NEW ALERT (customer name &gt; alert type &gt; device)

So I'd want to be picking out the customer name, which would be between '(' and '&gt;'. I'd then want to paste this in a cell in the same row, in column 'B'.

I'd want this to repeat for every cell in column 'M'.

I've tried various snippets of code, but none of them are the full deal, and my experience is so lackluster in VB I'm not entirely sure what I'm doing.

So my current code is as follows.

    Sub CustomerNames()
    
    Dim str As String
    Dim openPos As Integer
    Dim closePos As Integer
    Dim midBit As String 
    
    str = ActiveSheet.Range(""M"" &amp; Rows.Count).Select
    openPos = InStr(str, ""("")
    closePos = InStr(str, ""&gt;"")
    midBit = Mid(str, openPos + 1, closePos - openPos - 1)
    
    End Sub

So the results I'd like would be that the Macro would check every cell in column 'M', looking between the '(' and '&gt;' character in the string to find the customer name. It should then copy the string it's found to the corresponding cell in the same row in column 'B'.

The actual output makes no change to the spreadsheet at the moment.

&amp;#x200B;

I then tried the following, which still doesn't work. I basically need to copy the value between '(' and '&gt;' in the 'M' cell, and then paste it in the 'A' cell in the same row, for every row in the workbook.

I am a college student major in EE, currently I don't know whether I will be a software engineer after graduation.

But learning coding is my next plan,  I had started with Python currently.

I asked one of my friends who is good at coding, 

he told me it's better to start learn the fundamentals on CS if I want to be a software engineer as a career. 

Could you please give me some suggestions?

I want the Fragment to listen to the Handler but I don't know how to connect them.

I know how to implement an interface and then register a listener between two classes where the the Implementer(Listener) instantiates the caller. But that does not help for this scenario as the fragment is not aware of the handler.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;A nice little sketch I spent several hours on to help explain (SFW): &lt;a href=""https://ibb.co/Np6wxZt""&gt;https://ibb.co/Np6wxZt&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

I think I want to go into computer science in college, but it’s hard to feel certain about this choice from lack of a computer science course at my high school. I have some previous experience with very basic JavaScript, html, and basic-intermediate-ish python 3. About half of this was self taught from YouTube, but I was introduced through school in the past. Like i said however, my school doesn’t have any courses this year. 

So I was wondering, what do you all recommend I do next?  I might continue self studying in my free time (I am usually busy with my other classes), should I keep making stuff in python, or try to start learning c++ or JavaScript. I’ve heard that those two are harder than python, but I’ve also heard that they are more commonly used in college classes, and it may be good to get an introduction before taking a class. Another option MIGHT be taking one of the introductory level programming or introduction to cs courses at my local community college. The only thing about this is, I’m not sure if it would be too much of a jump in skill, and math backgrounds.  I would try to learn the basics of whatever language first, but I still wonder if it would be too much, despite me being a good student interested in the subject

I’m currently in math 3/ pre calculus, and will be taking AP Calculus AB next year at my school. Does this sound good? I also like science, and I’m  taking AP Biology (which I know most likely won’t help with cs but whatever, I still find it fascinating). I think I could be a good fit for the STEM field, but I also love other subjects as well, such as graphic design, video editing/production, and Biology. I wouldn’t want to end up in a depressing future with no creativity by putting aside these other interests, but the fact that programmers also make good money is an... additional influence towards coding. 

For some reason, the idea of web development with html etc. appeals to me, but I’m not exactly sure why.

If your still reading to this point, thank you, I know this is a long post but I’ve been thinking about all this for a while without anyone to ask really. I plan on making an appointment with my school counselor to discuss college, careers, and a bunch of other stuff, but I wanted to try here first.

with FPGAs you can program hardware, so for example you can customize a processor to your needs, implement it on the FPGA and program it with Arduino. You can also directly program the device and have as many parallel processes as you want without a loss of performance.

We made this accassable for beginners and software developers with our new language, IDE and tutorials.

You can try it here:  [https://vhdplus.com](https://vhdplus.com)

Everything is freeware. If you don't have an FPGA, we recommend the MAX1000 for less than 30$. Of course you can also try it without an FPGA.

We would like to hear your criticism and suggestions.

Thanks for helping!

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;let myArr = [‘bob’, ‘mary’, ‘joe’];&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I want to get the letter &lt;code&gt;m&lt;/code&gt; in Mary&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I &lt;code&gt;console.log(myArr[1]);&lt;/code&gt; I’ll get &lt;code&gt;Mary&lt;/code&gt; as my log&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What’s the syntax to get a specific letter from an array element?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks in advance&lt;/p&gt;

&amp;#x200B;

Hey everyone,

I am completely new to coding and just working through a simple problem but I cannot seem to get it and its driving me nuts. Could y'all help?

&amp;#x200B;

here is the code:

var products = \[""Choo Choo Chocolate"", ""Icy Mint"", ""Cake Batter"", ""Bubblegum""\];var hasBubbleGum = \[false, false, false, true\];var i = 0;

while (i &lt; hasBubbleGum.length) {

    if (hasBubbleGum[i]) { 

console.log(products\[i\] + "" contains bubblegum"");

}

i = i + 1;

}

// ...which logs ""Bubblegum contains bubblegum"" in the console.

What I'm not understanding is the following piece:  //if (hasBubbleGum\[i\])

//  Here's how I see it:During the first run through of the loop,  i = 0 so that particular string would be:  //

if (hasBubbleGum\[0\]) {

//  that means its pulling the first value of the array, which is 'false'.

So that would read: //

if (false) {console.log (product\[0\] + "" contains bubblegum"");

//  AKA  //

if (false) {console.log (Choo Choo Chocolate + "" contains bubblegum"");

//  ..and so on and so forth, causing my loop to log every value in the array.

However, when I type this into the console, that is NOT what I get at all. It only logs ""Bubblegum has bubblegum"" and I am at a loss as to how or why. Like I said I'm sure its something incredibly stupid and simple and I'm just not understanding something, but I cannot figure it out.

Any help understanding is very appreciated :'(","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;(ANSWERED/SOLVED!)&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;Create a project titled Assignment4\_Figures with a single file figures.cpp that asks the user for a number and then print a hollow square and two diagonal lines as shown below. The figure size should be input by the user. Here is an example dialog:  
&gt;  
&gt;Input number: 4

&gt;  
&gt;Note that your program has to work for an arbitrary integer, not just 4. You can use either while or for looping constructs.  
&gt;  
&gt;Hints: For each figure, you need to use two nested loops: the outer loop will iterate over rows (of stars) and the inner loop will print out the stars in a single row.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;In the second figure (the first diagonal line), you print a star when the row index is equal to the column index.  
&gt;  
&gt;In the third figure, you print a star when the column index is the same as the figure size minus the row index. To put another way row plus column equals figure size.  The code for the cross is the combination of the code for the two diagonal lines.  
&gt;  
&gt;To code the hollow square, consider using a multiway if with the following logic:  
&gt;  
&gt;  If it is the first line - then print a star  
&gt;  
&gt;  else if it is the last line - then print a star  
&gt;  
&gt;  else if it is the first column - then print a star

&gt;  else if it is the last column - then print a star

I'm having trouble with the entire program but my Professor told me if I finish item one in the list below the rest of the program is relatively easy.

    1. Write a Lisp function, convertToList (appropriate parameters), to read the road map file and create a list - for example, 1st invoke returns the list (oradea zerind sibiu), 2nd invoke returns the list (zerind oradea arad), etc.
    
    2. The provided code has a hash table to store cities a city is adjacent to. Update this code by integrating convertToList into it, so (convertToList  gets called, and) the hash table stores the stuff read off the data file - when done correctly,   a call (, for example,) to getAdjacents with argument zerind returns the list (oradea arad). [Recall hash tables from CS 3350 - hash table holds key value pairs, so for key zerind the value should be the list (oradea arad)] 
    
    3. Invoke the program so it does dfs &amp; finds the path from arad to bucharest, and prints [the ‘…’ below is the cities along the path, omitted for brevity]: 
    DepthFirstSearch solution:
    (ARAD ZERIND … BUCHAREST)
    
    4. Update the program so it can find the path b/w any two given cities – for example, invoking with parameters sibiu eforie prints some like [the ‘…’ below is the cities along the path (one per line), and are omitted for brevity]:
    DepthFirstSearch solution:
    (SIBIU … EFORIE)
    
    5. Add a routine expandedNodes so the program couts the path as in task 4, &amp; then couts the expanded nodes as shown below. Do not use additional memory to store the expanded nodes as the partial code already stores this info.
    Task 4 output as above
          	Nodes expanded in the solution process:
     (SIBIU ARAD ZERIND … EFORIE)

I know that's a lot to take in but bare with me.

I'm only focusing on item number one right now, I figured if you guys can see the entire picture that could help you guys giving me clues or resources or code on how to implement it myself. The code that was given to me is also found [here](https://pastebin.com/embed_js/cEUf3NLL)

I'm providing all of this just so we are all on the same page but my main issue is that I need to read information(line by line) from a file assign it to a list and then send that list over to another function. I understand I need

    (defund convertToList (with-open-file (stream ""desktop/file/NeededTextFile.txt"")
        (do ((line (read-line stream nil)
            (read-line stream nil)))
            (set 'List '(line))
            (SecondFunction List)) 

and then I'm lost. I figure I would need to make a loop in order to read more than just the first line. I found some code on StackOverflow but it looks like its just reads the line and does not assign it to a list. Not even sure if that works.

So pretty much the outline goes from text file --&gt; Lisp List --&gt; passed to another function. Then it loops back to do the second line in the txt file.

Also if there is a difference between Lisp and Common Lisp I think I'm using Common Lisp.

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am struggling with the main procedure where I am unable to reference the length variable of the value of &lt;strong&gt;rsi which I am lea&lt;/strong&gt; with &lt;strong&gt;[rdx]&lt;/strong&gt; in the global start section. Any assistance would be amazing as Stack overflow has become a nightmare and the reponses aren&amp;#39;t any assistance to me&lt;/p&gt;

I get the logic:

\- take the file

\- scan the line

\-take each digit and put it into array and add ',' next to it to it so its formatted

\-repeat?

but I don't really know how to put that into code. This is all I have as for my code - any help or guidance will be helpful

Repeatedly asks the user to enter a number or -1 to exit the program.

when I print mystack it shows, as below. basically its taking only adding the last element to linkedlist and later printing the same last element. Not sure why other elements are not getting added to the list. pls. suggest where Iam going wrong&lt;/p&gt;

Hello people, 

I got myself into a programming course again, and I got stuck on the very second assigned exercise. The topic is dynamic memory allocations, in particular of arrays, and functions.   
My difficulty is to understand how can I access an array allocated dynamically and then passed to a function by using pointers. To make things clearer, I have put together some simple code to show what I mean.  


    #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
    #include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
    
    
    void print_array(char **v, int m);
    
    int main()
    {
        int i, n;
        char *arr = NULL;
    
        printf(""Type array lenght: "");
        scanf(""%d"", &amp;n);
        getchar();
    
        arr = calloc(n, sizeof(char));
    
        printf(""Type %d characters: "", n);
        for(i=0; i&lt;n; i++){
            arr[i] = getchar();
        }
        printf(""\n"");
    
        for(i=0; i&lt;n; i++){
            printf(""arr[%d] = %c\n"", i, arr[i]);
        }
        printf(""\n"");
    
        print_array(&amp;arr, n);
    
    
        return 0;
    }
    
    void print_array(char **v, int m){
        int i;
    
         for(i=0; i&lt;m; i++){
            printf(""v[%d] = %c\n"", i, *v[i]);
        }
    
    }

Expected output: 

    Type array lenght: 5
    Type 5 characters: qwert
    
    arr[0] = q
    arr[1] = w
    arr[2] = e
    arr[3] = r
    arr[4] = t
    
    v[0] = q
    v[1] = w
    v[2] = e
    v[3] = r
    v[4] = t

Actual output:

    Type array lenght: 5
    Type 5 characters: qwert
    
    arr[0] = q
    arr[1] = w
    arr[2] = e
    arr[3] = r
    arr[4] = t
    
    v[0] = q

Inside the function, for some reason, I can only access the first character; when the program tries to access the second one, it shuts down with an error and does not return 0.  
This happens only with dynamically allocated memory. With static arrays passed to functions through pointers this does not happen and I do not understand why.

I am wondering now if there is some fundamental rule for dynamic allocations I am missing and not able to find, or something of this sort.

I am very sorry for not formatting the code properly at first. I am new to Reddit and I didn't know how the formatting options worked.** 

In this code there is an outer menu (let us call it menu 1) that has the following:

1. Log in as admin
2. Log in as student
3. Exit

A variable called `ch` holds the option number. If `ch` is selected to be 2, you get an inner menu (let us call it menu 2):

1. Log in with USN and password
2. Create new account
3. Go back to main menu

A variable called `ch3` holds the option number.  If `ch3` is selected to be 1, you get another inner menu (let us call it menu 3):

1. Enter USN and password
2. Go back to previous menu

A variable called `ch4` holds the option number. The idea is that if `ch4` is selected to be 2, the user will return to menu 2. If `ch4` is selected to be 1, the user gets a prompt asking for USN and password. Once the USN and password are entered, a while loop searches for the entered USN and password matching with those that have already been registered using the ""Create new account"" option.  If such a pair of USN and password are found, a variable `flag` is set to 1. If it is not found `flag` remains 0, and the user is informed that the USN and/or password entered is invalid, and the idea is that the user will return to menu 3.

The entire code is as follows:

Please help me find the error. Thank you.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit: I have solved the problem thanks to your help. I am very sorry for not formatting the code properly at first. I am new to Reddit and I didn&amp;#39;t know how the formatting options worked.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this code there is an outer menu (let us call it menu 1) that has the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Log in as admin&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Log in as student&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A variable called &lt;code&gt;ch&lt;/code&gt; holds the option number. If &lt;code&gt;ch&lt;/code&gt; is selected to be 2, you get an inner menu (let us call it menu 2):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Log in with USN and password&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create new account&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Go back to main menu&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A variable called &lt;code&gt;ch3&lt;/code&gt; holds the option number.  If &lt;code&gt;ch3&lt;/code&gt; is selected to be 1, you get another inner menu (let us call it menu 3):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enter USN and password&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Go back to previous menu&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A variable called &lt;code&gt;ch4&lt;/code&gt; holds the option number. The idea is that if &lt;code&gt;ch4&lt;/code&gt; is selected to be 2, the user will return to menu 2. If &lt;code&gt;ch4&lt;/code&gt; is selected to be 1, the user gets a prompt asking for USN and password. Once the USN and password are entered, a while loop searches for the entered USN and password matching with those that have already been registered using the &amp;quot;Create new account&amp;quot; option.  If such a pair of USN and password are found, a variable &lt;code&gt;flag&lt;/code&gt; is set to 1. If it is not found &lt;code&gt;flag&lt;/code&gt; remains 0, and the user is informed that the USN and/or password entered is invalid, and the idea is that the user will return to menu 3.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The entire code is as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;int main ()

So maybe removing all whitespace and looking for substrings of more than 50% match. this has problems with names like: 'The Red Pub' 'The Blue Pub'; 

not sure how to go about it when place names from different providers can be so varied; how do you reconcile them / remove duplicates without relying on distance offsets alone. 

Is this an NLP problem or can it be done with some substring manipulation magic stuff.

&lt;p&gt;So maybe removing all whitespace and looking for substrings of more than 50% match. this has problems with names like: &amp;#39;The Red Pub&amp;#39; &amp;#39;The Blue Pub&amp;#39;; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;not sure how to go about it when place names from different providers can be so varied; how do you reconcile them / remove duplicates without relying on distance offsets alone. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is this an NLP problem or can it be done with some substring manipulation magic stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Example Input &amp;amp; Expected Output:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;let places = [ &amp;#39;the card shop&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;card store&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;threads n&amp;#39; wear&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;threads &amp;amp; wear&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;the red pub&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;red pub&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;red bar&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;the blue pub&amp;#39;]

Tl,dr at the end


## Introduction

I am going to explain how I (M35) transitioned from unemployed living in Barcelona and with barely any front end knowledge to employed in Amsterdam as an entry level front end developer, within 5 months. The main reason why I am writing this post is because, while learning, I met other front end students and many of them saw things unnecessarily hard.

There is a huge demand for developers in the market right now. It is a great time to learn coding, and you don't need years and years of studies to be ""hirable"". A few months of focused learning are enough, and you don't need to spend a dime to learn.

I will explain what I did.

I hope this is useful to you.


## Why studying programming?

I think it is important to start with a positive mindset that somehow you can do this and it is a good idea. I didn't decide to learn front end development right off the bat, I did it because I clearly saw lots of opportunities:

- Using LinkedIn, I compared the amount of job offers (demand) with the amount of people with developer skills (offer). A simple LinkedIn search will give you some rough numbers. Programming had by far the best ratio of demand VS offer, compared to other markets I explored. In my eyes, programming became an obvious choice very, very quickly.

In the current market, as a developer odds are in your favor.

- I talked to a few HR firms, and they all told me that becoming a developer is a great idea because there is a lot of demand, and therefore I would find a job in no time.

- It's just common sense. Most companies, large or small, need some kind of web presence. Web technologies are constantly evolving. This means that you have endless opportunities to find new work.

This makes clear that web developer skills are currently very valuable, and that could help you find the idea of learning web development exciting.

Disclaimer:

I have no computer science degree, but I am more computer versed than the average person. During my PhD (in scientific research) I used linux all the time and became well acquainted with the unix shell (the command console) and the bare basics of programming languages. That was certainly useful to lose the fear to commands and consoles, but it is nothing you cannot acquire in a few days of studying.

Note: I've been told recently that having a PhD helped catch the eye of the interviewer. 


## Why front end web development?

I did compare offer VS demand ratios but it was not very obvious which field of engineering was a better choice. Other fields could have been an equally good or even better choice: data analysis, backend engineering or dev ops to name some. So I talked to people in the sector, asking them what field would bring me a job the fastest, and a couple of them recommended me to look into front end.

Literally one person told me: ""learn HTML, CSS, JavaScript and React, and you're good to get a starting job"".

He was not wrong.

Dev ops salaries are actually higher than in other fields. I would say ultimately depends on your own preferences and previous knowledge. For example, I picked front end for another reason, I am attracted to creating artwork and ""visual works"", so it was a more obvious choice for me. But that doesn't mean it's the best pick for everyone.


## How did I study? What resources did I use?

### FreeCodeCamp

I spent most of my waking hours studying in my room, since I was jobless anyway. I picked [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/), which I had seen recommended online, and followed its program for the first 3 modules. It is an entirely free (with optional donations if you want to help support it), very complete, ""study at your own pace"" introductory course.

I simply followed the program in FreeCodeCamp. It took me around one month to study the first three modules, which include HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript ES6, React/Redux, and a tiny bit of jQuery, Bootstrap and Sass. It is an excellent introduction to front end. You are going to be using most of these every day in your coding life.

### Anki for reviews

One important thing I did right from the start was to take notes of what I studied to later convert them into [Anki cards](https://apps.ankiweb.net/). Initially I also wrote summaries [you can see them here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1YNLZp0YglbjIDhMlyJNClsxasXxK3z_Q?usp=sharing), but I don't think these are worth the time spent on them. The Anki cards however were incredibly valuable. I created the Anki cards at the same time I studied, then every single day I studied the Anki deck. The main reason why Anki cards were so useful is that as you progress through the lessons, information keeps on piling up, and there's gonna be A LOT of new information you will have to learn. Without a review method, I would have forgotten most of the things I studied. Anki allowed me to remember almost everything in a very time-effective way.

I did not use Anki's default configuration. That would be worth its own article, but for starters you could read about the [Janki method](http://www.jackkinsella.ie/articles/janki-method). Making Anki cards is an art, and it is possible to make it wrong. There are 3 main things to keep in mind:

- One card = one and only one item to remember
- Find a quick way to create the cards (Now I write the questions and answers in a plain text file and import the file)
- Lower the repetition thresholds so that cards show up less frequently (to reduce the time spent in reviewing the cards)

That's all I did for about 4 or 5 weeks. I would say I spent on average 4 or 5 hours studying every single day, and it was hard work. If I had been working at the same time in a 40 hour/week job, I would have gone much slower. It is NOT EASY. It required full focus for hours, every day during weeks.

Anyway. I completed the first 3 modules of FreeCodeCamp. There are 7 modules in total, but I don't believe the last 4 are essential to find a job. They would be nice to have though, and would definitely increase your odds. But part of the reason why I am writing this, is to tell you what is the minimum you should do.

### JavaScript.info

After completing the freecodecamp modules I decided I should become a ""JavaScript expert"", so I began reading [javascript.info](http://javascript.info/). This is a very in-depth journey into JavaScript, and of course, it is 100% free. I found this resource very useful, and took the same approach of studying while making Anki cards. Why did I want to learn more about JavaScript? I felt that learning one programming language very well was the best use of my time. Tools, frameworks, these come and go, but JavaScript has come to stay. At least for quite a long while. Having a good grasp of JavaScript is a great use of your time, and when job interviews come, they will test your knowledge about the language. Understand well its nuances: the keyword ""this"", the differences between arrow functions and function declarations, asynchronous code and promises, spread operators, destructuring assignments... sometimes it's gonna be a bit hard for you to tell what is important or what is not when it comes to JavaScript. Particularly in the beginning. In case of doubt, learn it. It won't hurt you.

## What else did I do besides studying?

Besides studying frontend technologies, I also talked to people who worked as front end developers, recruiters, and bootcamp teachers. I talked to a handful of recruiters about my decision to move into the development world. This is the key information I got from them:

- There is indeed a huge need for developers in the market.
- Particularly, the Netherlands is a place in Europe where there is a developer shortage. Companies from this country go to other countries's job fairs to try and recruit talent. Me managing to easily find a job in Amsterdam supports this point.
- A recruiter told me ""the only thing you're missing is some kind of course certificate in your CV. It doesn't need to be official or expensive, anything does it"". The reason? A certificate or course makes it easier for me to sell my CV to companies, given that I have no work experience as a developer. To them, it shows commitment.

In addition, I found a government-funded bootcamp in my city which costed me zero money (only a few coins spent on the coffee machine). The quality was very low. I completed it nonetheless and added it to my CV. All in all, the bootcamp was not a very useful way to spend my time and I'm not sure if it factored in getting a job in any significant way. My guess is it didn't, so I won't expand into it. There's not much of a take away here. Ultimately, what interviewees care most about is whether you can use front end tools or not. In sum, having a course of sorts in your CV is not going to hurt you, but you don't NEED it so don't let it be a blocker.

How do you know when you are ready to look for a job? I had no idea back then. In retrospective, I would say that the minimum to get a first job is:

- Get well acquainted with HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript/ES6 and the fundamentals of one framework (React or Vue). This will take the longest time by far.
- Feel confortable with JS asynchronous code: that means Promises and async/await syntax.
- Understand the basics about fetching data as JSON from external resources via APIs.
- Goes without saying, but become familiar with an IDE, npm, git, github and some basic bash/unix commands. You'll get this knowledge while you learn the rest, so don't worry too much.


## How did I look for a job?

Nothing special. I searched with LinkedIn, Indeed and Google, and in a couple of local job boards of the Netherlands and Denmark.

I was very careful in crafting my resume. One friend (thank you Miguel) had fine tuned his by getting feedback from many recruiters over the years, and I used the same structure. The advice I got could be summarized as follows:

- Put the most relevant thing on top. Usually, relevant work experience is the most important thing. For your first job, it might be education instead. The most recent things should also go on top (always from newest to oldest).
- Limit your CV to one single A4 page in one side. That will force you to remove the unimportant.
- For each item in the CV (job experience, course...) use 2-4 bullet points to indicate what relevant things YOU (not your team) did. Be technical, brief and specific. Do not write long paragraphs, no one is going to read them.

I sent my resume as if I was shooting a machine gun, and I didn't use a motivation letter.

Finding a job was easy. My current job came out of spending one hour sending resumes. I only got a confirmation after 1 month, so I still put aside around 2 hours every 3 or 4 days to batch send resumes.


## How did the job interviews go?

The 4 interviews I did followed the same structure.

The first part was about getting to know you. You are asked why you applied to the job, what's your background and what are your expectations. Companies like smart employees that have a ""will do / will fix"" positive attitude and that don't plan to leave the company in 6 months. Try to show these traits while you tell your story and in the way you communicate. For example, I was warned that the rental market in Amsterdam is hard to navigate. I immediately replied that I've had to look for a flat abroad in other occasions, and that I was sure I could figure that out.

The second part was the technical interview. The key here is that, if you have studied enough, this will simply be about showing what you already know well, so you should not be worried about it. I faced 3 types of technical interviews, either explaining the code of a project you have done, being asked technical questions, or getting a homework project. Let's look at each one by one:

### Describing the code of one of your projects

I was asked to pick up any one of my recent projects, go through the code and explain it. At some point I was also asked to do a bit of code refactoring (improving your code for better readability and structure). In my opinion this is the most logical type of technical interview, because the fundamental knowledge is implied, and you are showing that you have technical knowledge. If you're going to face this interview, you must have learned well HTML, CSS, JavaScript ES6 and one frontend framework, and then you must have done 2 or 3 *TINY* projects with it. Think at the widget level more than at the full website level. This is the project I used in the interview: https://github.com/luismartinezs/studio-ghibli-books, as you can see it is very damn simple, but it was enough to show that I had a decent grasp of the fundamentals.

### Technical questions

I was asked about ES6 JavaScript features. What does it mean adding ""..."" in front of an array or an object? What are the differences between a function declaration and an arrow function? This type of evaluation is a bit trickier in my opinion, because you may get lucky or unlucky with the questions and your knowledge might be either overestimated or underestimated as a consequence.

### Homework projects

I was handed a project after an interview with Accenture. It took me around 20 hours to complete, and I only got a reply after one entire month (they replied that they wanted someone with more experience). This type of tests are usually asked for when the interviewer doesn't have technical knowledge and cannot evaluate you on the spot, so they pass the results of the test to the technical team for evaluation. I would suggest declining this type of tests. A company asking you to spend even 4 hours to solve a test just to evaluate you, rather than having someone from their technical team interview you, is asking you to waste your time. Only do the test if you have nothing better to do and you see the test as practice.

The bottom line is very simple: understand well the fundamentals, and the rest will follow.


## What would I do differently?

There's very little I would have done different. There's only one way I could have gone faster: first, skip the part about jQuery in freecodecamp. After finishing the first 3 modules of freecodecamp, I would have skipped the bootcamp and begun building 2 or 3 sample projects with React. These projects should:

- Look like something you might see in a website
- They should be very simple, e.g. 2-3 days per project, which at your initial level will be the time you'll need to do a very simple widget from scratch
- Need to incorporate proper calls to external APIs, using fetch.

Once I had these done, I would have begun looking for a job, as I would know everything required to perform decently well in an interview.

Thant's all for now. I'm happy to reply to any questions or comments that you may have.

&lt;p&gt;I am going to explain how I (M35) transitioned from unemployed living in Barcelona and with barely any front end knowledge to employed in Amsterdam as an entry level front end developer, within 5 months. The main reason why I am writing this post is because, while learning, I met other front end students and many of them saw things unnecessarily hard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a huge demand for developers in the market right now. It is a great time to learn coding, and you don&amp;#39;t need years and years of studies to be &amp;quot;hirable&amp;quot;. A few months of focused learning are enough, and you don&amp;#39;t need to spend a dime to learn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will explain what I did.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope this is useful to you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Why studying programming?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think it is important to start with a positive mindset that somehow you can do this and it is a good idea. I didn&amp;#39;t decide to learn front end development right off the bat, I did it because I clearly saw lots of opportunities:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using LinkedIn, I compared the amount of job offers (demand) with the amount of people with developer skills (offer). A simple LinkedIn search will give you some rough numbers. Programming had by far the best ratio of demand VS offer, compared to other markets I explored. In my eyes, programming became an obvious choice very, very quickly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the current market, as a developer odds are in your favor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I talked to a few HR firms, and they all told me that becoming a developer is a great idea because there is a lot of demand, and therefore I would find a job in no time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s just common sense. Most companies, large or small, need some kind of web presence. Web technologies are constantly evolving. This means that you have endless opportunities to find new work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This makes clear that web developer skills are currently very valuable, and that could help you find the idea of learning web development exciting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Disclaimer:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have no computer science degree, but I am more computer versed than the average person. During my PhD (in scientific research) I used linux all the time and became well acquainted with the unix shell (the command console) and the bare basics of programming languages. That was certainly useful to lose the fear to commands and consoles, but it is nothing you cannot acquire in a few days of studying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note: I&amp;#39;ve been told recently that having a PhD helped catch the eye of the interviewer. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Why front end web development?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did compare offer VS demand ratios but it was not very obvious which field of engineering was a better choice. Other fields could have been an equally good or even better choice: data analysis, backend engineering or dev ops to name some. So I talked to people in the sector, asking them what field would bring me a job the fastest, and a couple of them recommended me to look into front end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Literally one person told me: &amp;quot;learn HTML, CSS, JavaScript and React, and you&amp;#39;re good to get a starting job&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He was not wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dev ops salaries are actually higher than in other fields. I would say ultimately depends on your own preferences and previous knowledge. For example, I picked front end for another reason, I am attracted to creating artwork and &amp;quot;visual works&amp;quot;, so it was a more obvious choice for me. But that doesn&amp;#39;t mean it&amp;#39;s the best pick for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;How did I study? What resources did I use?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;FreeCodeCamp&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I spent most of my waking hours studying in my room, since I was jobless anyway. I picked &lt;a href=""https://www.freecodecamp.org/""&gt;FreeCodeCamp&lt;/a&gt;, which I had seen recommended online, and followed its program for the first 3 modules. It is an entirely free (with optional donations if you want to help support it), very complete, &amp;quot;study at your own pace&amp;quot; introductory course.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I simply followed the program in FreeCodeCamp. It took me around one month to study the first three modules, which include HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript ES6, React/Redux, and a tiny bit of jQuery, Bootstrap and Sass. It is an excellent introduction to front end. You are going to be using most of these every day in your coding life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Anki for reviews&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One important thing I did right from the start was to take notes of what I studied to later convert them into &lt;a href=""https://apps.ankiweb.net/""&gt;Anki cards&lt;/a&gt;. Initially I also wrote summaries &lt;a href=""https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1YNLZp0YglbjIDhMlyJNClsxasXxK3z_Q?usp=sharing""&gt;you can see them here&lt;/a&gt;, but I don&amp;#39;t think these are worth the time spent on them. The Anki cards however were incredibly valuable. I created the Anki cards at the same time I studied, then every single day I studied the Anki deck. The main reason why Anki cards were so useful is that as you progress through the lessons, information keeps on piling up, and there&amp;#39;s gonna be A LOT of new information you will have to learn. Without a review method, I would have forgotten most of the things I studied. Anki allowed me to remember almost everything in a very time-effective way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did not use Anki&amp;#39;s default configuration. That would be worth its own article, but for starters you could read about the &lt;a href=""http://www.jackkinsella.ie/articles/janki-method""&gt;Janki method&lt;/a&gt;. Making Anki cards is an art, and it is possible to make it wrong. There are 3 main things to keep in mind:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One card = one and only one item to remember&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Find a quick way to create the cards (Now I write the questions and answers in a plain text file and import the file)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lower the repetition thresholds so that cards show up less frequently (to reduce the time spent in reviewing the cards)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s all I did for about 4 or 5 weeks. I would say I spent on average 4 or 5 hours studying every single day, and it was hard work. If I had been working at the same time in a 40 hour/week job, I would have gone much slower. It is NOT EASY. It required full focus for hours, every day during weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway. I completed the first 3 modules of FreeCodeCamp. There are 7 modules in total, but I don&amp;#39;t believe the last 4 are essential to find a job. They would be nice to have though, and would definitely increase your odds. But part of the reason why I am writing this, is to tell you what is the minimum you should do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;JavaScript.info&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After completing the freecodecamp modules I decided I should become a &amp;quot;JavaScript expert&amp;quot;, so I began reading &lt;a href=""http://javascript.info/""&gt;javascript.info&lt;/a&gt;. This is a very in-depth journey into JavaScript, and of course, it is 100% free. I found this resource very useful, and took the same approach of studying while making Anki cards. Why did I want to learn more about JavaScript? I felt that learning one programming language very well was the best use of my time. Tools, frameworks, these come and go, but JavaScript has come to stay. At least for quite a long while. Having a good grasp of JavaScript is a great use of your time, and when job interviews come, they will test your knowledge about the language. Understand well its nuances: the keyword &amp;quot;this&amp;quot;, the differences between arrow functions and function declarations, asynchronous code and promises, spread operators, destructuring assignments... sometimes it&amp;#39;s gonna be a bit hard for you to tell what is important or what is not when it comes to JavaScript. Particularly in the beginning. In case of doubt, learn it. It won&amp;#39;t hurt you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What else did I do besides studying?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Besides studying frontend technologies, I also talked to people who worked as front end developers, recruiters, and bootcamp teachers. I talked to a handful of recruiters about my decision to move into the development world. This is the key information I got from them:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is indeed a huge need for developers in the market.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Particularly, the Netherlands is a place in Europe where there is a developer shortage. Companies from this country go to other countries&amp;#39;s job fairs to try and recruit talent. Me managing to easily find a job in Amsterdam supports this point.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A recruiter told me &amp;quot;the only thing you&amp;#39;re missing is some kind of course certificate in your CV. It doesn&amp;#39;t need to be official or expensive, anything does it&amp;quot;. The reason? A certificate or course makes it easier for me to sell my CV to companies, given that I have no work experience as a developer. To them, it shows commitment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, I found a government-funded bootcamp in my city which costed me zero money (only a few coins spent on the coffee machine). The quality was very low. I completed it nonetheless and added it to my CV. All in all, the bootcamp was not a very useful way to spend my time and I&amp;#39;m not sure if it factored in getting a job in any significant way. My guess is it didn&amp;#39;t, so I won&amp;#39;t expand into it. There&amp;#39;s not much of a take away here. Ultimately, what interviewees care most about is whether you can use front end tools or not. In sum, having a course of sorts in your CV is not going to hurt you, but you don&amp;#39;t NEED it so don&amp;#39;t let it be a blocker.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How do you know when you are ready to look for a job? I had no idea back then. In retrospective, I would say that the minimum to get a first job is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get well acquainted with HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript/ES6 and the fundamentals of one framework (React or Vue). This will take the longest time by far.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Feel confortable with JS asynchronous code: that means Promises and async/await syntax.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Understand the basics about fetching data as JSON from external resources via APIs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Goes without saying, but become familiar with an IDE, npm, git, github and some basic bash/unix commands. You&amp;#39;ll get this knowledge while you learn the rest, so don&amp;#39;t worry too much.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;How did I look for a job?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nothing special. I searched with LinkedIn, Indeed and Google, and in a couple of local job boards of the Netherlands and Denmark.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was very careful in crafting my resume. One friend (thank you Miguel) had fine tuned his by getting feedback from many recruiters over the years, and I used the same structure. The advice I got could be summarized as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Put the most relevant thing on top. Usually, relevant work experience is the most important thing. For your first job, it might be education instead. The most recent things should also go on top (always from newest to oldest).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Limit your CV to one single A4 page in one side. That will force you to remove the unimportant.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For each item in the CV (job experience, course...) use 2-4 bullet points to indicate what relevant things YOU (not your team) did. Be technical, brief and specific. Do not write long paragraphs, no one is going to read them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I sent my resume as if I was shooting a machine gun, and I didn&amp;#39;t use a motivation letter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finding a job was easy. My current job came out of spending one hour sending resumes. I only got a confirmation after 1 month, so I still put aside around 2 hours every 3 or 4 days to batch send resumes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;How did the job interviews go?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 4 interviews I did followed the same structure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first part was about getting to know you. You are asked why you applied to the job, what&amp;#39;s your background and what are your expectations. Companies like smart employees that have a &amp;quot;will do / will fix&amp;quot; positive attitude and that don&amp;#39;t plan to leave the company in 6 months. Try to show these traits while you tell your story and in the way you communicate. For example, I was warned that the rental market in Amsterdam is hard to navigate. I immediately replied that I&amp;#39;ve had to look for a flat abroad in other occasions, and that I was sure I could figure that out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second part was the technical interview. The key here is that, if you have studied enough, this will simply be about showing what you already know well, so you should not be worried about it. I faced 3 types of technical interviews, either explaining the code of a project you have done, being asked technical questions, or getting a homework project. Let&amp;#39;s look at each one by one:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Describing the code of one of your projects&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was asked to pick up any one of my recent projects, go through the code and explain it. At some point I was also asked to do a bit of code refactoring (improving your code for better readability and structure). In my opinion this is the most logical type of technical interview, because the fundamental knowledge is implied, and you are showing that you have technical knowledge. If you&amp;#39;re going to face this interview, you must have learned well HTML, CSS, JavaScript ES6 and one frontend framework, and then you must have done 2 or 3 &lt;em&gt;TINY&lt;/em&gt; projects with it. Think at the widget level more than at the full website level. This is the project I used in the interview: &lt;a href=""https://github.com/luismartinezs/studio-ghibli-books""&gt;https://github.com/luismartinezs/studio-ghibli-books&lt;/a&gt;, as you can see it is very damn simple, but it was enough to show that I had a decent grasp of the fundamentals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Technical questions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was asked about ES6 JavaScript features. What does it mean adding &amp;quot;...&amp;quot; in front of an array or an object? What are the differences between a function declaration and an arrow function? This type of evaluation is a bit trickier in my opinion, because you may get lucky or unlucky with the questions and your knowledge might be either overestimated or underestimated as a consequence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Homework projects&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was handed a project after an interview with Accenture. It took me around 20 hours to complete, and I only got a reply after one entire month (they replied that they wanted someone with more experience). This type of tests are usually asked for when the interviewer doesn&amp;#39;t have technical knowledge and cannot evaluate you on the spot, so they pass the results of the test to the technical team for evaluation. I would suggest declining this type of tests. A company asking you to spend even 4 hours to solve a test just to evaluate you, rather than having someone from their technical team interview you, is asking you to waste your time. Only do the test if you have nothing better to do and you see the test as practice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bottom line is very simple: understand well the fundamentals, and the rest will follow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What would I do differently?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s very little I would have done different. There&amp;#39;s only one way I could have gone faster: first, skip the part about jQuery in freecodecamp. After finishing the first 3 modules of freecodecamp, I would have skipped the bootcamp and begun building 2 or 3 sample projects with React. These projects should:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Look like something you might see in a website&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They should be very simple, e.g. 2-3 days per project, which at your initial level will be the time you&amp;#39;ll need to do a very simple widget from scratch&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Need to incorporate proper calls to external APIs, using fetch.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once I had these done, I would have begun looking for a job, as I would know everything required to perform decently well in an interview.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thant&amp;#39;s all for now. I&amp;#39;m happy to reply to any questions or comments that you may have.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Links&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.freecodecamp.org/""&gt;FreeCodeCamp&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=""https://apps.ankiweb.net/""&gt;Anki cards&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=""http://www.jackkinsella.ie/articles/janki-method""&gt;Janki method&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=""http://javascript.info/""&gt;javascript.info&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=""https://github.com/luismartinezs/studio-ghibli-books""&gt;A project I used in a job interview&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;tl,dr&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;From jobless and with no specific frontend knowledge to an entry level job in 5 months&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Money spent: 0&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Time spent studying: roughly 2.5 months, around 5 hours per day.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Study material: mainly freecodecamp modules 1 to 3 and javascript.info&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Focused studying, with emphasis on deep understanding&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use a review system for the things you learn, Anki cards or something else&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Put some effort in structuring well your resume so that it&amp;#39;s relevant and easy to read&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

I can't pretend to know my way around APIs generally and Spotify's API specifically, but I had an idea for an upcoming friend-hackathon and I would appreciate your initial guidance.

Background: I am a huge power user of Spotify and in addition to finding music through Spotify's increasingly intelligent curation algorithms, I also discover lots of my music through my friends on Spotify, either by sifting through their playlists or by observing the songs they are listening to via Spotify's ""Friend Activity"" sidebar.

Feature request: I like this ""Friend Activity"" capability but I wish it could be enhanced in two ways: (i) can friend activity  be visible on mobile so I can tune in on-the-go? And (ii) can I literally ""tune-in"" to their session like I would a radio station through some sort of ""synchronous/go live"" mode so we can both be listening to whatever it is that the friend plays? Sort of like FB Live, anyone could tune into anyone else's ""live mix sessions"": I'd like to explore ways this can be built.
