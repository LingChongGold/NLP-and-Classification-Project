CodeTinkerer,hard teach programming,many years ago taught programming years college intro level computer science took break tried ten years ago year since mostly software development land recently post beginner tutorials bad let relate story reaction years ago ruby rails perhaps height attended conference sort called fluff stuff idea traveling band speakers would talk anything microsoft ruby rails fit bill java javascript also popular well agile etc one speaker making rounds dave thomas old enough wendy guy maybe know pragmatic programmer guy certainly lot popularize ruby think helped translate ruby book japanese least approximation translation english helped popularity outside japan talks building apps ruby rails gave one talk differing levels expertise novice complete beginner expert experts noted much like guy commenting beginner tutorials tend talk high level shorthand one another good beginners related story beginner flying airplanes made rookie mistakes instructor warned point people want create tutorial know audience beginners deliberately assuming seen dozen languages ph astrophysics making attempt explain stuff think beginner level mean every expert failed explain something somewhat simply bother colleges already far gone teach even people struggled master something sometimes fixate much issues may kind obscure general interest student rather present stuff might easy tough others biggest problem much expert lost touch although partly true need experience teaching means need teach students test see understand understand need find thinking causing problems means imo need talk students figure coming try get understand think programming problem teachers taught get feedback students revise teach problems saw example one semester teaching html one part course end semester pretty much forgotten html made every test many cumulative forced review html second semester taught think retained better yes maybe forgot months later another story lesson hard teach teach front students talk understand coming misconceptions adjust learning books general kinda like books webpages structured like books linear structure physical books often editors review content webpages often lack books problem though want learn book want use book reference books attempt lean reference book example one c book taught started print statements one chapter input conditionals next loops next chapter arrays functions pointers structures etc split way related information loops say loops loops nested loops etc one chapter maybe better way teach use loop introduce loops much later go back review loops split might better ordering teaching might worse reference syntax vs writing program learn foreign language university vs learning online program perhaps biggest difference approach university probably going teach rather formally talking nouns verbs conjugation grammar want look language linguist would hand popular language courses teaching useful phrases mostly skipping grammar least emphasizing much aimed tourists expected reach level mastery good enough communicate understand key phrases happens programming language instruction looking intro material elixirschool first several chapters syntax syntax syntax libraries list functions libraries equivalent teaching grammar creative writing course without ever getting writing part contrast video tutorials like learn phrases approach teaching foreign language sometimes care getting application work without worrying much basics programming even going example might tutorial write blog ruby rails may cover web application basically structured structured way person learned ruby might say strange essentially learn things superficial level detail learning functions library might useful want something different understand thinking lead design first place code particularly brittle one little error left wondering fix dave thomas said one thing novice wants precision well defined set tasks visible goals want hear takes pinch salt teaspoon mean taste many professional chefs would argue average home cook scared salt undersalts much food something aimed beginners try follow mantra debugging right one task beginner lot fixing bugs recall books ever going topic much might probably cover debugger problem covering debugger need pick ide languages define debugger part langauge pick ide popularity book tutorial probably goes environment programming ok let say book somehow manages cover programs problem solved think resulting program run start worry bunch things install language know version install upgrade language next version workflow write program ide use text editor many books tutorials start single file approach entire program one file interesting test programming language deals two program files c simple approach cc foo c bar c baz c wanted compile three c files one main add arguments cc c compiler compile one executable nearly every modern language moved sort build tool teach deal one file run almost never really supposed leiningen clojure go build go programs mix elixir even beyond make decision editor use use full ide books tutorials shy away recommending ide happens student says use college prefer ide may stop reading reading elixir sets projects exactly explained c really notion projects elixir many tutorials take granted language works certain way bother explain works way probably author know elixir directory test programs consensus need testing part language explanation testing needed elixir approach testing read program books tend teach syntax lucky might tell write programs rare see books chapters devoted debugging need problem want complicated understanding problem hard enough let alone debugging many books cover reading program going line line program almost like programming writing reading people end maintaining code people wrote building mental model suppose wanted hire bunch people build house get supervise provide instructions see results correct mistakes hopefully quickly programming done somewhat blind see code see values changing unless get good using debugger understand mentally program imagine want build house time house built robot provide instructions provide ahead time robot build house away sight get look done seen many students look code static sort way really trace step step code fix code random changes know lack patience follow step step let try spinning phantom menace reference inventing syntax young kids hear foreign language pretend speak imitating sounds maybe hear ee er san hear chinese mon dieu hear french pig latin applying rules make faux latin guess quite often beginners apply rules taught infer based personal experience even without seeing many students write code like x mean x value feel equality operator distributes many languages comes semi intelligent place happens wrong java languages compare method many things returns really returns negative zero positive numbers believe first true going wonder comparing giving right answers balanced approach think need balance teaching syntax writing programs syntax sit around nothing probably hard absorb material anyway many programs possible understand read programs copying code think writing programs conclusion teach beginners need teach beginners preferably put content internet stuff think simple might hard stuff think hard might simple worry order teach skills want person develop intend learn frequent quizzing teachers sometimes rather selfish teaching often teachers even talk teach years recall many conversations teach basically left devices recall someone disagreed wrote tests disagreed assessment never really discussion topic final reason hard teach programming every complete beginner perhaps biggest fallacy beginners lack knowledge programming may someone else may much bigger potential learn quickly compared despite knowing little fallacy somehow best book best tutorial mostly tyranny choice many choices fear making bad decision hope best somehow make easy others also likely happen finally learning programming tough easily ask questions get feedback structure making lot decisions
